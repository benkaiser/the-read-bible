The valiant men are in scarlet. The chariots flash with steel in the day of his preparation, and the pine spears are brandished.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#xA0;</span>The chariots rage in the streets. They rush back and forth in the wide ways. Their appearance is like torches. They run like the lightnings.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#xA0;</span>He summons his picked troops. They stumble on their way. They dash to its wall, and the protective shield is put in place.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#xA0;</span>The gates of the rivers are opened, and the palace is dissolved.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#xA0;</span>It is decreed: she is uncovered, she is carried away; and her servants moan as with the voice of doves, beating on their breasts.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#xA0;</span>But Nineveh has been from of old like a pool of water, yet they flee away. &#x201C;Stop!
