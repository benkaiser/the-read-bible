Don&#x2019;t go to glean in another field, and don&#x2019;t go from here, but stay here close to my maidens.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#xA0;</span>Let your eyes be on the field that they reap, and go after them. Haven&#x2019;t I commanded the young men not to touch you? When you are thirsty, go to the vessels, and drink from that which the young men have drawn.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#xA0;</span>Then she fell on her face and bowed herself to the ground, and said to him, &#x201C;Why have I found favour in your sight, that you should take knowledge of me, since I am a foreigner?&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#xA0;</span>Boaz answered her, &#x201C;I have been told all about what you have done for your mother-in-law since the death of your husband, and how you have left your father, your mother, and the land of your birth, and have come to a people that you didn&#x2019;t know before.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#xA0;</span>May the LORD repay your work, and a full reward be given to you from the LORD, the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to take refuge.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#xA0;</span>Then she said, &#x201C;Let me find favour in your sight, my lord, because you have comforted me, and because you have spoken kindly to your servant, though I am not as one of your servants.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#xA0;</span>At meal time Boaz said to her, &#x201C;Come here, and eat some bread, and dip your morsel in the vinegar.&#x201D; </div><div class="p">She sat beside the reapers, and they passed her parched grain. She ate, was satisfied, and left some of it.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#xA0;</span>When she had risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, &#x201C;Let her glean even amongst the sheaves, and don&#x2019;t reproach her.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#xA0;</span>Also pull out some for her from the bundles, and leave it. Let her glean, and don&#x2019;t rebuke her.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#xA0;</span>So she gleaned in the field until evening; and she beat out that which she had gleaned, and it was about an ephah<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> 1 ephah is about 22 litres or about 2/3 of a bushel</span></a> of barley.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#xA0;</span>She took it up, and went into the city. Then her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned; and she brought out and gave to her that which she had left after she had enough. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#xA0;</span>Her mother-in-law said to her, &#x201C;Where have you gleaned today? Where have you worked? Blessed be he who noticed you.&#x201D; </div><div class="p">She told her mother-in-law with whom she had worked, &#x201C;The man&#x2019;s name with whom I worked today is Boaz.&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#xA0;</span>Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, &#x201C;May he be blessed by the LORD, who has not abandoned his kindness to the living and to the dead.&#x201D; Naomi said to her, &#x201C;The man is a close relative to us, one of our near kinsmen.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#xA0;</span>Ruth the Moabitess said, &#x201C;Yes, he said to me, &#x2018;You shall stay close to my young men until they have finished all my harvest.&#x2019;&#xA0;&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#xA0;</span>Naomi said to Ruth her daughter-in-law, &#x201C;It is good, my daughter, that you go out with his maidens, and that they not meet you in any other field.&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#xA0;</span>So she stayed close to the maidens of Boaz, to glean to the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and she lived with her mother-in-law. </div>
