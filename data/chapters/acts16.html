There was a man of Macedonia standing, begging him and saying, &#x201C;Come over into Macedonia and help us.&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#xA0;</span>When he had seen the vision, immediately we sought to go out to Macedonia, concluding that the Lord had called us to preach the Good News to them.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#xA0;</span>Setting sail therefore from Troas, we made a straight course to Samothrace, and the day following to Neapolis;  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#xA0;</span>and from there to Philippi, which is a city of Macedonia, the foremost of the district, a Roman colony. We were staying some days in this city. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#xA0;</span>On the Sabbath day we went outside of the city by a riverside, where we supposed there was a place of prayer, and we sat down and spoke to the women who had come together.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#xA0;</span>A certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, one who worshipped God, heard us. The Lord opened her heart to listen to the things which were spoken by Paul.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#xA0;</span>When she and her household were baptised, she begged us, saying, &#x201C;If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house and stay.&#x201D; So she persuaded us. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#xA0;</span>As we were going to prayer, a certain girl having a spirit of divination met us, who brought her masters much gain by fortune telling.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#xA0;</span>Following Paul and us, she cried out, &#x201C;These men are servants of the Most High God, who proclaim to us a way of salvation!&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#xA0;</span>She was doing this for many days. </div><div class="p">But Paul, becoming greatly annoyed, turned and said to the spirit, &#x201C;I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her!&#x201D; It came out that very hour.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#xA0;</span>But when her masters saw that the hope of their gain was gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the marketplace before the rulers.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#xA0;</span>When they had brought them to the magistrates, they said, &#x201C;These men, being Jews, are agitating our city  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#xA0;</span>and advocate customs which it is not lawful for us to accept or to observe, being Romans.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#xA0;</span>The multitude rose up together against them and the magistrates tore their clothes from them, then commanded them to be beaten with rods.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#xA0;</span>When they had laid many stripes on them, they threw them into prison, charging the jailer to keep them safely.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#xA0;</span>Having received such a command, he threw them into the inner prison and secured their feet in the stocks. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#xA0;</span>But about midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the prisoners were listening to them.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#xA0;</span>Suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken; and immediately all the doors were opened, and everyone&#x2019;s bonds were loosened.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#xA0;</span>The jailer, being roused out of sleep and seeing the prison doors open, drew his sword and was about to kill himself, supposing that the prisoners had escaped.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#xA0;</span>But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t harm yourself, for we are all here!&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#xA0;</span>He called for lights, sprang in, fell down trembling before Paul and Silas,  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#xA0;</span>brought them out, and said, &#x201C;Sirs, what must I do to be saved?&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#xA0;</span>They said, &#x201C;Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and you will be saved, you and your household.&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#xA0;</span>They spoke the word of the Lord to him, and to all who were in his house. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#xA0;</span>He took them the same hour of the night and washed their stripes, and was immediately baptised, he and all his household.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#xA0;</span>He brought them up into his house and set food before them, and rejoiced greatly with all his household, having believed in God. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#xA0;</span>But when it was day, the magistrates sent the sergeants, saying, &#x201C;Let those men go.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#xA0;</span>The jailer reported these words to Paul, saying, &#x201C;The magistrates have sent to let you go; now therefore come out and go in peace.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#xA0;</span>But Paul said to them, &#x201C;They have beaten us publicly without a trial, men who are Romans, and have cast us into prison! Do they now release us secretly? No, most certainly, but let them come themselves and bring us out!&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#xA0;</span>The sergeants reported these words to the magistrates, and they were afraid when they heard that they were Romans,  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#xA0;</span>and they came and begged them. When they had brought them out, they asked them to depart from the city.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#xA0;</span>They went out of the prison and entered into Lydia&#x2019;s house. When they had seen the brothers, they encouraged them, then departed. </div>
