His hand prevailed against Cushan Rishathaim.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#xA0;</span>The land had rest forty years, then Othniel the son of Kenaz died. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#xA0;</span>The children of Israel again did that which was evil in the LORD&#x2019;s sight, and the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done that which was evil in the LORD&#x2019;s sight.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#xA0;</span>He gathered the children of Ammon and Amalek to himself; and he went and struck Israel, and they possessed the city of palm trees.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#xA0;</span>The children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#xA0;</span>But when the children of Israel cried to the LORD, the LORD raised up a saviour for them: Ehud the son of Gera, the Benjamite, a left-handed man. The children of Israel sent tribute by him to Eglon the king of Moab.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#xA0;</span>Ehud made himself a sword which had two edges, a cubit<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> A cubit is the length from the tip of the middle finger to the elbow on a man&#x2019;s arm, or about 18 inches or 46 centimetres.</span></a> in length; and he wore it under his clothing on his right thigh.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#xA0;</span>He offered the tribute to Eglon king of Moab. Now Eglon was a very fat man.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#xA0;</span>When Ehud had finished offering the tribute, he sent away the people who carried the tribute.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#xA0;</span>But he himself turned back from the stone idols that were by Gilgal, and said, &#x201C;I have a secret message for you, O king.&#x201D; </div><div class="p">The king said, &#x201C;Keep silence!&#x201D; All who stood by him left him. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#xA0;</span>Ehud came to him; and he was sitting by himself alone in the cool upper room. Ehud said, &#x201C;I have a message from God to you.&#x201D; He arose out of his seat.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#xA0;</span>Ehud put out his left hand, and took the sword from his right thigh, and thrust it into his body.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#xA0;</span>The handle also went in after the blade; and the fat closed on the blade, for he didn&#x2019;t draw the sword out of his body; and it came out behind.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#xA0;</span>Then Ehud went out onto the porch, and shut the doors of the upper room on him, and locked them. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#xA0;</span>After he had gone, his servants came and saw that the doors of the upper room were locked. They said, &#x201C;Surely he is covering his feet<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">&#x2020;<span class="popup"> or, &#x201C;relieving himself&#x201D;.</span></a> in the upper room.&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#xA0;</span>They waited until they were ashamed; and behold, he didn&#x2019;t open the doors of the upper room. Therefore they took the key and opened them, and behold, their lord had fallen down dead on the floor. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#xA0;</span>Ehud escaped while they waited, passed beyond the stone idols, and escaped to Seirah.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#xA0;</span>When he had come, he blew a trumpet in the hill country of Ephraim; and the children of Israel went down with him from the hill country, and he led them. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#xA0;</span>He said to them, &#x201C;Follow me; for the LORD has delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand.&#x201D; They followed him, and took the fords of the Jordan against the Moabites, and didn&#x2019;t allow any man to pass over.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#xA0;</span>They struck at that time about ten thousand men of Moab, every strong man and every man of valour. No man escaped.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#xA0;</span>So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. Then the land had rest eighty years. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#xA0;</span>After him was Shamgar the son of Anath, who struck six hundred men of the Philistines with an ox goad. He also saved Israel. </div>
