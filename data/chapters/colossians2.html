He made you alive together with him, having forgiven us all our trespasses,  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#xA0;</span>wiping out the handwriting in ordinances which was against us. He has taken it out of the way, nailing it to the cross.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#xA0;</span>Having stripped the principalities and the powers, he made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#xA0;</span>Let no one therefore judge you in eating or drinking, or with respect to a feast day or a new moon or a Sabbath day,  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#xA0;</span>which are a shadow of the things to come; but the body is Christ&#x2019;s.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#xA0;</span>Let no one rob you of your prize by self-abasement and worshipping of the angels, dwelling in the things which he has not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#xA0;</span>and not holding firmly to the Head, from whom all the body, being supplied and knit together through the joints and ligaments, grows with God&#x2019;s growth. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#xA0;</span>If you died with Christ from the elemental spirits of the world, why, as though living in the world, do you subject yourselves to ordinances,  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#xA0;</span>&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t handle, nor taste, nor touch&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#xA0;</span>(all of which perish with use), according to the precepts and doctrines of men?  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#xA0;</span>These things indeed appear like wisdom in self-imposed worship, humility, and severity to the body, but aren&#x2019;t of any value against the indulgence of the flesh. </div>
