Its height reached to the sky and its sight to the end of all the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#xA0;</span>Its leaves were beautiful, and it had much fruit, and in it was food for all. The animals of the field had shade under it, and the birds of the sky lived in its branches, and all flesh was fed from it. </div><div class="pi"> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#xA0;</span>&#x201C;I saw in the visions of my head on my bed, and behold, a holy watcher came down from the sky.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#xA0;</span>He cried aloud and said this: &#x2018;Cut down the tree, and cut off its branches! Shake off its leaves and scatter its fruit! Let the animals get away from under it and the birds from its branches.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#xA0;</span>Nevertheless leave the stump of its roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and bronze, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of the sky. Let his portion be with the animals in the grass of the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#xA0;</span>Let his heart be changed from man&#x2019;s, and let an animal&#x2019;s heart be given to him.

Let his portion be with the animals of the field, until seven times pass over him.&#x2019; </div><div class="pi"> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#xA0;</span>&#x201C;This is the interpretation, O king, and it is the decree of the Most High, which has come on my lord the king:  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#xA0;</span>You will be driven from men and your dwelling shall be with the animals of the field. You will be made to eat grass as oxen, and will be wet with the dew of the sky, and seven times shall pass over you, until you know that the Most High rules in the kingdom of men, and gives it to whomever he will.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#xA0;</span>Whereas it was commanded to leave the stump of the roots of the tree, your kingdom shall be sure to you after you know that Heavens rules.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#xA0;</span>Therefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable to you, and break off your sins by righteousness, and your iniquities by showing mercy to the poor. Perhaps there may be a lengthening of your tranquillity.&#x201D; </div><div class="pi"> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#xA0;</span>All this came on the King Nebuchadnezzar.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#xA0;</span>At the end of twelve months he was walking in the royal palace of Babylon.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#xA0;</span>The king spoke and said, &#x201C;Is not this great Babylon, which I have built for the royal dwelling place by the might of my power and for the glory of my majesty?&#x201D; </div><div class="pi"> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#xA0;</span>While the word was in the king&#x2019;s mouth, a voice came from the sky, saying, &#x201C;O King Nebuchadnezzar, to you it is spoken: &#x2018;The kingdom has departed from you.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#xA0;</span>You shall be driven from men, and your dwelling shall be with the animals of the field. You shall be made to eat grass like oxen. Seven times shall pass over you, until you know that the Most High rules in the kingdom of men, and gives it to whomever he will.&#x2019;&#xA0;&#x201D; </div><div class="pi"> <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#xA0;</span>This was fulfilled the same hour on Nebuchadnezzar. He was driven from men and ate grass like oxen; and his body was wet with the dew of the sky until his hair had grown like eagles&#x2019; feathers, and his nails like birds&#x2019; claws. </div><div class="pi"> <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#xA0;</span>At the end of the days I, Nebuchadnezzar, lifted up my eyes to heaven, and my understanding returned to me; and I blessed the Most High, and I praised and honoured him who lives forever, </div><div class="q">for his dominion is an everlasting dominion, </div><div class="q2">and his kingdom from generation to generation. </div><div class="q"> <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#xA0;</span>All the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing; </div><div class="q2">and he does according to his will in the army of heaven, </div><div class="q2">and amongst the inhabitants of the earth; </div><div class="q">and no one can stop his hand, </div><div class="q2">or ask him, &#x201C;What are you doing?&#x201D; </div><div class="pi"> <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#xA0;</span>At the same time my understanding returned to me; and for the glory of my kingdom, my majesty and brightness returned to me. My counsellors and my lords sought me; and I was established in my kingdom, and excellent greatness was added to me.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#xA0;</span>Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and extol and honour the King of heaven; for all his works are truth, and his ways justice; and those who walk in pride he is able to abase. </div>
