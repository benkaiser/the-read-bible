The LORD swore to them that he wouldn&#x2019;t let them see the land which the LORD swore to their fathers that he would give us, a land flowing with milk and honey.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#xA0;</span>Their children, whom he raised up in their place, were circumcised by Joshua, for they were uncircumcised, because they had not circumcised them on the way.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#xA0;</span>When they were done circumcising the whole nation, they stayed in their places in the camp until they were healed. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#xA0;</span>The LORD said to Joshua, &#x201C;Today I have rolled away the reproach of Egypt from you.&#x201D; Therefore the name of that place was called Gilgal<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> &#x201C;Gilgal&#x201D; sounds like the Hebrew for &#x201C;roll.&#x201D;</span></a> to this day.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#xA0;</span>The children of Israel encamped in Gilgal.

The children of Israel didn&#x2019;t have manna any more, but they ate of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#xA0;</span>When Joshua was by Jericho, he lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, a man stood in front of him with his sword drawn in his hand.
