Nobody could bind him any more, not even with chains,  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#xA0;</span>because he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been torn apart by him, and the fetters broken in pieces. Nobody had the strength to tame him.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#xA0;</span>Always, night and day, in the tombs and in the mountains, he was crying out, and cutting himself with stones.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#xA0;</span>When he saw Jesus from afar, he ran and bowed down to him,  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#xA0;</span>and crying out with a loud voice, he said, &#x201C;What have I to do with you, Jesus, you Son of the Most High God? I adjure you by God, don&#x2019;t torment me.&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#xA0;</span>For he said to him, <span class="wj">&#x201C;Come out of the man, you unclean spirit!&#x201D; </span> </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#xA0;</span>He asked him, <span class="wj">&#x201C;What is your name?&#x201D;</span> </div><div class="p">He said to him, &#x201C;My name is Legion, for we are many.&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#xA0;</span>He begged him much that he would not send them away out of the country.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#xA0;</span>Now on the mountainside there was a great herd of pigs feeding.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#xA0;</span>All the demons begged him, saying, &#x201C;Send us into the pigs, that we may enter into them.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#xA0;</span>At once Jesus gave them permission.
