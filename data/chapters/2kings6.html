Behold, they besieged it until a donkey&#x2019;s head was sold for eighty pieces of silver, and the fourth part of a kab<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> A kab was about 2 litres, so a fourth of a kab would be about 500 milliliters or about a pint</span></a> of dove&#x2019;s dung for five pieces of silver.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#xA0;</span>As the king of Israel was passing by on the wall, a woman cried to him, saying, &#x201C;Help, my lord, O king!&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#xA0;</span>He said, &#x201C;If the LORD doesn&#x2019;t help you, where could I get help for you?
