This is vanity, and it is an evil disease. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#xA0;</span>If a man fathers a hundred children, and lives many years, so that the days of his years are many, but his soul is not filled with good, and moreover he has no burial, I say that a stillborn child is better than he;  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#xA0;</span>for it comes in vanity, and departs in darkness, and its name is covered with darkness.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#xA0;</span>Moreover it has not seen the sun nor known it. This has rest rather than the other.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#xA0;</span>Yes, though he live a thousand years twice told, and yet fails to enjoy good, don&#x2019;t all go to one place?  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#xA0;</span>All the labour of man is for his mouth, and yet the appetite is not filled.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#xA0;</span>For what advantage has the wise more than the fool? What has the poor man, that knows how to walk before the living?  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#xA0;</span>Better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the desire. This also is vanity and a chasing after wind.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#xA0;</span>Whatever has been, its name was given long ago; and it is known what man is; neither can he contend with him who is mightier than he.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#xA0;</span>For there are many words that create vanity. What does that profit man?  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#xA0;</span>For who knows what is good for man in life, all the days of his vain life which he spends like a shadow? For who can tell a man what will be after him under the sun? </div>
