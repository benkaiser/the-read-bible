<div class="chapterlabel" id="V0"> 3</div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#xA0;</span>The child Samuel ministered to the LORD before Eli. The LORD&#x2019;s word was rare in those days. There were not many visions, then.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#xA0;</span>At that time, when Eli was laid down in his place (now his eyes had begun to grow dim, so that he could not see),  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#xA0;</span>and God&#x2019;s lamp hadn&#x2019;t yet gone out, and Samuel had laid down in the LORD&#x2019;s temple where God&#x2019;s ark was,  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#xA0;</span>The LORD called Samuel. He said, &#x201C;Here I am.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#xA0;</span>He ran to Eli and said, &#x201C;Here I am; for you called me.&#x201D; </div><div class="p">He said, &#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t call. Lie down again.&#x201D; </div><div class="p">He went and lay down.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#xA0;</span>The LORD called yet again, &#x201C;Samuel!&#x201D; </div><div class="p">Samuel arose and went to Eli and said, &#x201C;Here I am; for you called me.&#x201D; </div><div class="p">He answered, &#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t call, my son. Lie down again.&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#xA0;</span>Now Samuel didn&#x2019;t yet know the LORD, neither was the LORD&#x2019;s word yet revealed to him.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#xA0;</span>The LORD called Samuel again the third time. He arose and went to Eli and said, &#x201C;Here I am; for you called me.&#x201D; </div><div class="p">Eli perceived that the LORD had called the child.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#xA0;</span>Therefore Eli said to Samuel, &#x201C;Go, lie down. It shall be, if he calls you, that you shall say, &#x2018;Speak, LORD; for your servant hears.&#x2019;&#xA0;&#x201D; So Samuel went and lay down in his place.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#xA0;</span>The LORD came, and stood, and called as at other times, &#x201C;Samuel! Samuel!&#x201D; </div><div class="p">Then Samuel said, &#x201C;Speak; for your servant hears.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#xA0;</span>The LORD said to Samuel, &#x201C;Behold, I will do a thing in Israel at which both the ears of everyone who hears it will tingle.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#xA0;</span>In that day I will perform against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house, from the beginning even to the end.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#xA0;</span>For I have told him that I will judge his house forever for the iniquity which he knew, because his sons brought a curse on themselves, and he didn&#x2019;t restrain them.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#xA0;</span>Therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli that the iniquity of Eli&#x2019;s house shall not be removed with sacrifice or offering forever.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#xA0;</span>Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the LORD&#x2019;s house. Samuel was afraid to show Eli the vision.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#xA0;</span>Then Eli called Samuel and said, &#x201C;Samuel, my son!&#x201D; </div><div class="p">He said, &#x201C;Here I am.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#xA0;</span>He said, &#x201C;What is the thing that he has spoken to you? Please don&#x2019;t hide it from me. God do so to you, and more also, if you hide anything from me of all the things that he spoke to you.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#xA0;</span>Samuel told him every bit, and hid nothing from him. </div><div class="p">He said, &#x201C;It is the LORD. Let him do what seems good to him.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#xA0;</span>Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him and let none of his words fall to the ground.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#xA0;</span>All Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of the LORD.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#xA0;</span>The LORD appeared again in Shiloh; for the LORD revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the LORD&#x2019;s word. </div>
