I will water it every moment. Lest anyone damage it, I will keep it night and day.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#xA0;</span>Wrath is not in me, but if I should find briers and thorns, I would do battle! I would march on them and I would burn them together.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#xA0;</span>Or else let him take hold of my strength, that he may make peace with me.

Or are they killed like those who killed them were killed?  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#xA0;</span>In measure, when you send them away, you contend with them. He has removed them with his rough blast in the day of the east wind.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#xA0;</span>Therefore by this the iniquity of Jacob will be forgiven, and this is all the fruit of taking away his sin: that he makes all the stones of the altar as chalk stones that are beaten in pieces, so that the Asherah poles and the incense altars shall rise no more.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#xA0;</span>For the fortified city is solitary, a habitation deserted and forsaken, like the wilderness. The calf will feed there, and there he will lie down, and consume its branches.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#xA0;</span>When its boughs are withered, they will be broken off. The women will come and set them on fire, for they are a people of no understanding.
