Then he would heal him of his leprosy.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#xA0;</span>Someone went in and told his lord, saying, &#x201C;The girl who is from the land of Israel said this.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#xA0;</span>The king of Syria said, &#x201C;Go now, and I will send a letter to the king of Israel.&#x201D; </div><div class="p">He departed, and took with him ten talents<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> A talent is about 30 kilograms or 66 pounds</span></a> of silver, six thousand pieces of gold, and ten changes of clothing.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#xA0;</span>He brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, &#x201C;Now when this letter has come to you, behold, I have sent Naaman my servant to you, that you may heal him of his leprosy.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#xA0;</span>When the king of Israel had read the letter, he tore his clothes and said, &#x201C;Am I God, to kill and to make alive, that this man sends to me to heal a man of his leprosy? But please consider and see how he seeks a quarrel against me.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#xA0;</span>It was so, when Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying, &#x201C;Why have you torn your clothes? Let him come now to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#xA0;</span>So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariots, and stood at the door of the house of Elisha.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#xA0;</span>Elisha sent a messenger to him, saying, &#x201C;Go and wash in the Jordan seven times, and your flesh shall come again to you, and you shall be clean.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#xA0;</span>But Naaman was angry, and went away and said, &#x201C;Behold, I thought, &#x2018;He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of the LORD his God, and wave his hand over the place, and heal the leper.&#x2019;  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#xA0;</span>Aren&#x2019;t Abanah and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? Couldn&#x2019;t I wash in them and be clean?&#x201D; So he turned and went away in a rage. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#xA0;</span>His servants came near and spoke to him, and said, &#x201C;My father, if the prophet had asked you do some great thing, wouldn&#x2019;t you have done it? How much rather then, when he says to you, &#x2018;Wash, and be clean?&#x2019;&#xA0;&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#xA0;</span>Then went he down and dipped himself seven times in the Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God; and his flesh was restored like the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#xA0;</span>He returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and came, and stood before him; and he said, &#x201C;See now, I know that there is no God in all the earth, but in Israel. Now therefore, please take a gift from your servant.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#xA0;</span>But he said, &#x201C;As the LORD lives, before whom I stand, I will receive none.&#x201D; </div><div class="p">He urged him to take it; but he refused.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#xA0;</span>Naaman said, &#x201C;If not, then, please let two mules&#x2019; load of earth be given to your servant; for your servant will from now on offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice to other gods, but to the LORD.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#xA0;</span>In this thing may the LORD pardon your servant: when my master goes into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he leans on my hand, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon. When I bow myself in the house of Rimmon, may the LORD pardon your servant in this thing.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#xA0;</span>He said to him, &#x201C;Go in peace.&#x201D; </div><div class="p">So he departed from him a little way.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#xA0;</span>But Gehazi the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, &#x201C;Behold, my master has spared this Naaman the Syrian, in not receiving at his hands that which he brought. As the LORD lives, I will run after him, and take something from him.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#xA0;</span>So Gehazi followed after Naaman. When Naaman saw one running after him, he came down from the chariot to meet him, and said, &#x201C;Is all well?&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#xA0;</span>He said, &#x201C;All is well. My master has sent me, saying, &#x2018;Behold, even now two young men of the sons of the prophets have come to me from the hill country of Ephraim. Please give them a talent<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">&#x2020;<span class="popup"> A talent is about 30 kilograms or 66 pounds</span></a> of silver and two changes of clothing.&#x2019;&#xA0;&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#xA0;</span>Naaman said, &#x201C;Be pleased to take two talents.&#x201D; He urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of clothing, and laid them on two of his servants; and they carried them before him.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#xA0;</span>When he came to the hill, he took them from their hand, and stored them in the house. Then he let the men go, and they departed.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#xA0;</span>But he went in, and stood before his master. Elisha said to him, &#x201C;Where did you come from, Gehazi?&#x201D; </div><div class="p">He said, &#x201C;Your servant went nowhere.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#xA0;</span>He said to him, &#x201C;Didn&#x2019;t my heart go with you when the man turned from his chariot to meet you? Is it a time to receive money, and to receive garments, and olive groves and vineyards, and sheep and cattle, and male servants and female servants?  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#xA0;</span>Therefore the leprosy of Naaman will cling to you and to your offspring<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">&#x2021;<span class="popup"> or, seed</span></a> forever.&#x201D; </div><div class="p">He went out from his presence a leper, as white as snow. </div>
