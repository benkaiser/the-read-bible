They will be called after the name of their brothers in their inheritance.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#xA0;</span>As for me, when I came from Paddan, Rachel died beside me in the land of Canaan on the way, when there was still some distance to come to Ephrath, and I buried her there on the way to Ephrath (also called Bethlehem).&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#xA0;</span>Israel saw Joseph&#x2019;s sons, and said, &#x201C;Who are these?&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#xA0;</span>Joseph said to his father, &#x201C;They are my sons, whom God has given me here.&#x201D; </div><div class="p">He said, &#x201C;Please bring them to me, and I will bless them.&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#xA0;</span>Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he couldn&#x2019;t see well. Joseph brought them near to him; and he kissed them, and embraced them.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#xA0;</span>Israel said to Joseph, &#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t think I would see your face, and behold, God has let me see your offspring also.&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#xA0;</span>Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#xA0;</span>Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand towards Israel&#x2019;s left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand towards Israel&#x2019;s right hand, and brought them near to him.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#xA0;</span>Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it on Ephraim&#x2019;s head, who was the younger, and his left hand on Manasseh&#x2019;s head, guiding his hands knowingly, for Manasseh was the firstborn.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#xA0;</span>He blessed Joseph, and said, </div><div class="q">&#x201C;The God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked, </div><div class="q">the God who has fed me all my life long to this day, </div><div class="q"> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#xA0;</span>the angel who has redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads, </div><div class="q">and let my name be named on them, </div><div class="q">and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac. </div><div class="q">Let them grow into a multitude upon the earth.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#xA0;</span>When Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand on the head of Ephraim, it displeased him. He held up his father&#x2019;s hand, to remove it from Ephraim&#x2019;s head to Manasseh&#x2019;s head.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#xA0;</span>Joseph said to his father, &#x201C;Not so, my father, for this is the firstborn. Put your right hand on his head.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#xA0;</span>His father refused, and said, &#x201C;I know, my son, I know. He also will become a people, and he also will be great. However, his younger brother will be greater than he, and his offspring will become a multitude of nations.&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#xA0;</span>He blessed them that day, saying, &#x201C;Israel will bless in you, saying, &#x2018;God make you as Ephraim and as Manasseh&#x2019;&#xA0;&#x201D; He set Ephraim before Manasseh.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#xA0;</span>Israel said to Joseph, &#x201C;Behold, I am dying, but God will be with you, and bring you again to the land of your fathers.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#xA0;</span>Moreover I have given to you one portion above your brothers, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.&#x201D; </div>
