The man was an elderly old man in the days of Saul.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#xA0;</span>The three oldest sons of Jesse had gone after Saul to the battle; and the names of his three sons who went to the battle were Eliab the firstborn, and next to him Abinadab, and the third Shammah.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#xA0;</span>David was the youngest; and the three oldest followed Saul.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#xA0;</span>Now David went back and forth from Saul to feed his father&#x2019;s sheep at Bethlehem. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#xA0;</span>The Philistine came near morning and evening, and presented himself forty days. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#xA0;</span>Jesse said to David his son, &#x201C;Now take for your brothers an ephah<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">&#xA7;<span class="popup"> 1 ephah is about 22 litres or about 2/3 of a bushel</span></a> of this parched grain and these ten loaves, and carry them quickly to the camp to your brothers;  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#xA0;</span>and bring these ten cheeses to the captain of their thousand; and see how your brothers are doing, and bring back news.&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#xA0;</span>Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel were in the valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#xA0;</span>David rose up early in the morning and left the sheep with a keeper, and took the provisions and went, as Jesse had commanded him. He came to the place of the wagons as the army which was going out to the fight shouted for the battle.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#xA0;</span>Israel and the Philistines put the battle in array, army against army.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#xA0;</span>David left his baggage in the hand of the keeper of the baggage and ran to the army, and came and greeted his brothers.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#xA0;</span>As he talked with them, behold, the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, came up out of the ranks of the Philistines, and said the same words; and David heard them.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#xA0;</span>All the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him and were terrified.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#xA0;</span>The men of Israel said, &#x201C;Have you seen this man who has come up?

I know your pride and the evil of your heart; for you have come down that you might see the battle.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#xA0;</span>David said, &#x201C;What have I now done?

When he arose against me, I caught him by his beard, struck him, and killed him.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#xA0;</span>Your servant struck both the lion and the bear. This uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, since he has defied the armies of the living God.&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#xA0;</span>David said, &#x201C;The LORD, who delivered me out of the paw of the lion and out of the paw of the bear, will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine.&#x201D; </div><div class="p">Saul said to David, &#x201C;Go!

David said to Saul, &#x201C;I can&#x2019;t go with these, for I have not tested them.&#x201D; Then David took them off. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#xA0;</span>He took his staff in his hand, and chose for himself five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them in the pouch of his shepherd&#x2019;s bag which he had. His sling was in his hand; and he came near to the Philistine.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#xA0;</span>The Philistine walked and came near to David; and the man who bore the shield went before him.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#xA0;</span>When the Philistine looked around and saw David, he disdained him; for he was but a youth, and ruddy, and had a good looking face.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#xA0;</span>The Philistine said to David, &#x201C;Am I a dog, that you come to me with sticks?&#x201D; The Philistine cursed David by his gods.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#xA0;</span>The Philistine said to David, &#x201C;Come to me, and I will give your flesh to the birds of the sky and to the animals of the field.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#xA0;</span>Then David said to the Philistine, &#x201C;You come to me with a sword, with a spear, and with a javelin; but I come to you in the name of the LORD of Armies, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#xA0;</span>Today, the LORD will deliver you into my hand. I will strike you and take your head from off you.

The stone sank into his forehead, and he fell on his face to the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#xA0;</span>So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and struck the Philistine and killed him; but there was no sword in David&#x2019;s hand.  <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#xA0;</span>Then David ran, stood over the Philistine, took his sword, drew it out of its sheath, killed him, and cut off his head with it. </div><div class="p">When the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, they fled.  <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#xA0;</span>The men of Israel and of Judah arose and shouted, and pursued the Philistines as far as Gai and to the gates of Ekron.
