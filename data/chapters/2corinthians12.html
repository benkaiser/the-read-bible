But I refrain, so that no man may think more of me than that which he sees in me or hears from me.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#xA0;</span>By reason of the exceeding greatness of the revelations, that I should not be exalted excessively, a thorn in the flesh was given to me: a messenger of Satan to torment me, that I should not be exalted excessively.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#xA0;</span>Concerning this thing, I begged the Lord three times that it might depart from me.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#xA0;</span>He has said to me, <span class="wj">&#x201C;My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.&#x201D;</span> Most gladly therefore I will rather glory in my weaknesses, that the power of Christ may rest on me. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#xA0;</span>Therefore I take pleasure in weaknesses, in injuries, in necessities, in persecutions, and in distresses, for Christ&#x2019;s sake. For when I am weak, then am I strong.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#xA0;</span>I have become foolish in boasting. You compelled me, for I ought to have been commended by you, for I am in no way inferior to the very best apostles, though I am nothing.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#xA0;</span>Truly the signs of an apostle were worked amongst you in all perseverance, in signs and wonders and mighty works.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#xA0;</span>For what is there in which you were made inferior to the rest of the assemblies, unless it is that I myself was not a burden to you? Forgive me this wrong! </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#xA0;</span>Behold, this is the third time I am ready to come to you, and I will not be a burden to you; for I seek not your possessions, but you. For the children ought not to save up for the parents, but the parents for the children.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#xA0;</span>I will most gladly spend and be spent for your souls. If I love you more abundantly, am I loved the less?  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#xA0;</span>Even so, I myself didn&#x2019;t burden you. But you might say that being crafty, I caught you with deception.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#xA0;</span>Did I take advantage of you by anyone of those whom I have sent to you?  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#xA0;</span>I exhorted Titus, and I sent the brother with him. Did Titus take any advantage of you? Didn&#x2019;t we walk in the same spirit? Didn&#x2019;t we walk in the same steps? </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#xA0;</span>Again, do you think that we are excusing ourselves to you? In the sight of God we speak in Christ. But all things, beloved, are for your edifying.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#xA0;</span>For I am afraid that perhaps when I come, I might find you not the way I want to, and that I might be found by you as you don&#x2019;t desire, that perhaps there would be strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, factions, slander, whisperings, proud thoughts, or riots,  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#xA0;</span>that again when I come my God would humble me before you, and I would mourn for many of those who have sinned before now, and not repented of the uncleanness, sexual immorality, and lustfulness which they committed. </div>
