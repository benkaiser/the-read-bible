<div class="chapterlabel" id="V0"> 2</div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#xA0;</span>In the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king, when wine was before him, I picked up the wine, and gave it to the king. Now I had not been sad before in his presence.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#xA0;</span>The king said to me, &#x201C;Why is your face sad, since you are not sick? This is nothing else but sorrow of heart.&#x201D; </div><div class="p">Then I was very much afraid.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#xA0;</span>I said to the king, &#x201C;Let the king live forever! Why shouldn&#x2019;t my face be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers&#x2019; tombs, lies waste, and its gates have been consumed with fire?&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#xA0;</span>Then the king said to me, &#x201C;What is your request?&#x201D; </div><div class="p">So I prayed to the God of heaven.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#xA0;</span>I said to the king, &#x201C;If it pleases the king, and if your servant has found favour in your sight, I ask that you would send me to Judah, to the city of my fathers&#x2019; tombs, that I may build it.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#xA0;</span>The king said to me (the queen was also sitting by him), &#x201C;How long will your journey be? When will you return?&#x201D; </div><div class="p">So it pleased the king to send me, and I set a time for him.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#xA0;</span>Moreover I said to the king, &#x201C;If it pleases the king, let letters be given me to the governors beyond the River, that they may let me pass through until I come to Judah;  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#xA0;</span>and a letter to Asaph the keeper of the king&#x2019;s forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the citadel by the temple, for the wall of the city, and for the house that I will occupy.&#x201D; </div><div class="p">The king granted my requests, because of the good hand of my God on me.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#xA0;</span>Then I came to the governors beyond the River, and gave them the king&#x2019;s letters. Now the king had sent captains of the army and horsemen with me.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#xA0;</span>When Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite servant heard of it, it grieved them exceedingly, because a man had come to seek the welfare of the children of Israel. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#xA0;</span>So I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#xA0;</span>I arose in the night, I and a few men with me. I didn&#x2019;t tell anyone what my God put into my heart to do for Jerusalem. There wasn&#x2019;t any animal with me except the animal that I rode on.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#xA0;</span>I went out by night by the valley gate towards the jackal&#x2019;s well, then to the dung gate; and I inspected the walls of Jerusalem, which were broken down, and its gates were consumed with fire.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#xA0;</span>Then I went on to the spring gate and to the king&#x2019;s pool, but there was no place for the animal that was under me to pass.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#xA0;</span>Then I went up in the night by the brook and inspected the wall; and I turned back, and entered by the valley gate, and so returned.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#xA0;</span>The rulers didn&#x2019;t know where I went, or what I did. I had not as yet told it to the Jews, nor to the priests, nor to the nobles, nor to the rulers, nor to the rest who did the work. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#xA0;</span>Then I said to them, &#x201C;You see the bad situation that we are in, how Jerusalem lies waste, and its gates are burnt with fire. Come, let&#x2019;s build up the wall of Jerusalem, that we won&#x2019;t be disgraced.&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#xA0;</span>I told them about the hand of my God which was good on me, and also about the king&#x2019;s words that he had spoken to me. </div><div class="p">They said, &#x201C;Let&#x2019;s rise up and build.&#x201D; So they strengthened their hands for the good work. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#xA0;</span>But when Sanballat the Horonite, Tobiah the Ammonite servant, and Geshem the Arabian, heard it, they ridiculed us and despised us, and said, &#x201C;What is this thing that you are doing? Will you rebel against the king?&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#xA0;</span>Then I answered them, and said to them, &#x201C;The God of heaven will prosper us. Therefore we, his servants, will arise and build; but you have no portion, nor right, nor memorial in Jerusalem.&#x201D; </div>
