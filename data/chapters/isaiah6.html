Each one had six wings. With two he covered his face. With two he covered his feet. With two he flew.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#xA0;</span>One called to another, and said, </div><div class="q">&#x201C;Holy, holy, holy, is the LORD of Armies! </div><div class="q2">The whole earth is full of his glory!&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#xA0;</span>The foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him who called, and the house was filled with smoke.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#xA0;</span>Then I said, &#x201C;Woe is me! For I am undone, because I am a man of unclean lips and I live amongst a people of unclean lips, for my eyes have seen the King, the LORD of Armies!&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#xA0;</span>Then one of the seraphim flew to me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#xA0;</span>He touched my mouth with it, and said, &#x201C;Behold, this has touched your lips; and your iniquity is taken away, and your sin forgiven.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#xA0;</span>I heard the Lord&#x2019;s voice, saying, &#x201C;Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?&#x201D; </div><div class="p">Then I said, &#x201C;Here I am. Send me!&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#xA0;</span>He said, &#x201C;Go, and tell this people, </div><div class="q">&#x2018;You hear indeed, </div><div class="q2">but don&#x2019;t understand. </div><div class="q">You see indeed, </div><div class="q2">but don&#x2019;t perceive.&#x2019; </div><div class="q"> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#xA0;</span>Make the heart of this people fat. </div><div class="q2">Make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; </div><div class="q">lest they see with their eyes, </div><div class="q2">hear with their ears, </div><div class="q2">understand with their heart, </div><div class="q2">and turn again, and be healed.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#xA0;</span>Then I said, &#x201C;Lord, how long?&#x201D; </div><div class="p">He answered, </div><div class="q">&#x201C;Until cities are waste without inhabitant, </div><div class="q2">houses without man, </div><div class="q2">the land becomes utterly waste, </div><div class="q2"> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#xA0;</span>and the LORD has removed men far away, </div><div class="q2">and the forsaken places are many within the land. </div><div class="q"> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#xA0;</span>If there is a tenth left in it, </div><div class="q2">that also will in turn be consumed, </div><div class="q">as a terebinth, and as an oak whose stump remains when they are cut down, </div><div class="q2">so the holy seed is its stump.&#x201D; </div>
