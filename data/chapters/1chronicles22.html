I will therefore make preparation for it.&#x201D; So David prepared abundantly before his death.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#xA0;</span>Then he called for Solomon his son, and commanded him to build a house for the LORD, the God of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#xA0;</span>David said to Solomon his son, &#x201C;As for me, it was in my heart to build a house to the name of the LORD my God.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#xA0;</span>But the LORD&#x2019;s word came to me, saying, &#x2018;You have shed blood abundantly and have made great wars. You shall not build a house to my name, because you have shed much blood on the earth in my sight.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#xA0;</span>Behold, a son shall be born to you, who shall be a man of peace. I will give him rest from all his enemies all around; for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quietness to Israel in his days.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#xA0;</span>He shall build a house for my name; and he will be my son, and I will be his father; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel forever.&#x2019;  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#xA0;</span>Now, my son, may the LORD be with you and prosper you, and build the house of the LORD your God, as he has spoken concerning you.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#xA0;</span>May the LORD give you discretion and understanding, and put you in charge of Israel, so that you may keep the law of the LORD your God.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#xA0;</span>Then you will prosper, if you observe to do the statutes and the ordinances which the LORD gave Moses concerning Israel. Be strong and courageous. Don&#x2019;t be afraid and don&#x2019;t be dismayed.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#xA0;</span>Now, behold, in my affliction I have prepared for the LORD&#x2019;s house one hundred thousand talents<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> A talent is about 30 kilograms or 66 pounds or 965 Troy ounces, so 100,000 talents is about 3 metric tonnes</span></a> of gold, one million talents<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">&#x2020;<span class="popup"> about 30,000 metric tonnes</span></a> of silver, and bronze and iron without weight; for it is in abundance. I have also prepared timber and stone; and you may add to them.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#xA0;</span>There are also workmen with you in abundance&#x2014;cutters and workers of stone and timber, and all kinds of men who are skilful in every kind of work;  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#xA0;</span>of the gold, the silver, the bronze, and the iron, there is no number. Arise and be doing, and may the LORD be with you.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#xA0;</span>David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon his son, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#xA0;</span>&#x201C;Isn&#x2019;t the LORD your God with you? Hasn&#x2019;t he given you rest on every side? For he has delivered the inhabitants of the land into my hand; and the land is subdued before the LORD and before his people.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#xA0;</span>Now set your heart and your soul to follow the LORD your God. Arise therefore, and build the sanctuary of the LORD God, to bring the ark of the LORD&#x2019;s covenant and the holy vessels of God into the house that is to be built for the LORD&#x2019;s name.&#x201D; </div>
