Then you will know that I am the LORD.&#x2019;&#xA0;&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#xA0;</span>Ahab said, &#x201C;By whom?&#x201D; </div><div class="p">He said, &#x201C;The LORD says, &#x2018;By the young men of the princes of the provinces.&#x2019;&#xA0;&#x201D; </div><div class="p">Then he said, &#x201C;Who shall begin the battle?&#x201D; </div><div class="p">He answered, &#x201C;You.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#xA0;</span>Then he mustered the young men of the princes of the provinces, and they were two hundred and thirty-two.

But Ben Hadad was drinking himself drunk in the pavilions, he and the kings, the thirty-two kings who helped him.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#xA0;</span>The young men of the princes of the provinces went out first; and Ben Hadad sent out, and they told him, saying, &#x201C;Men are coming out from Samaria.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#xA0;</span>He said, &#x201C;If they have come out for peace, take them alive; or if they have come out for war, take them alive.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#xA0;</span>So these went out of the city, the young men of the princes of the provinces, and the army which followed them.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#xA0;</span>They each killed his man. The Syrians fled, and Israel pursued them. Ben Hadad the king of Syria escaped on a horse with horsemen.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#xA0;</span>The king of Israel went out and struck the horses and chariots, and killed the Syrians with a great slaughter.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#xA0;</span>The prophet came near to the king of Israel and said to him, &#x201C;Go, strengthen yourself, and plan what you must do, for at the return of the year, the king of Syria will come up against you.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#xA0;</span>The servants of the king of Syria said to him, &#x201C;Their god is a god of the hills; therefore they were stronger than we.

We will fight against them in the plain, and surely we will be stronger than they are.&#x201D; </div><div class="p">He listened to their voice and did so.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#xA0;</span>At the return of the year, Ben Hadad mustered the Syrians and went up to Aphek to fight against Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#xA0;</span>The children of Israel were mustered and given provisions, and went against them. The children of Israel encamped before them like two little flocks of young goats, but the Syrians filled the country.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#xA0;</span>A man of God came near and spoke to the king of Israel, and said, &#x201C;The LORD says, &#x2018;Because the Syrians have said, &#x201C;The LORD is a god of the hills, but he is not a god of the valleys,&#x201D; therefore I will deliver all this great multitude into your hand, and you shall know that I am the LORD.&#x2019;&#xA0;&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#xA0;</span>They encamped opposite each other for seven days.

Ben Hadad fled and came into the city, into an inner room.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#xA0;</span>His servants said to him, &#x201C;See now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings.

Maybe he will save your life.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#xA0;</span>So they put sackcloth on their bodies and ropes on their heads, and came to the king of Israel, and said, &#x201C;Your servant Ben Hadad says, &#x2018;Please let me live.&#x2019;&#xA0;&#x201D; </div><div class="p">He said, &#x201C;Is he still alive?
