They will pursue you until you perish.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#xA0;</span>Your sky that is over your head will be bronze, and the earth that is under you will be iron.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#xA0;</span>The LORD will make the rain of your land powder and dust. It will come down on you from the sky, until you are destroyed.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#xA0;</span>The LORD will cause you to be struck before your enemies. You will go out one way against them, and will flee seven ways before them. You will be tossed back and forth amongst all the kingdoms of the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#xA0;</span>Your dead bodies will be food to all birds of the sky, and to the animals of the earth; and there will be no one to frighten them away.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#xA0;</span>The LORD will strike you with the boils of Egypt, with the tumours, with the scurvy, and with the itch, of which you can not be healed.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#xA0;</span>The LORD will strike you with madness, with blindness, and with astonishment of heart.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#xA0;</span>You will grope at noonday, as the blind gropes in darkness, and you shall not prosper in your ways. You will only be oppressed and robbed always, and there will be no one to save you.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#xA0;</span>You will betroth a wife, and another man shall lie with her. You will build a house, and you won&#x2019;t dwell in it.

There will be no power in your hand.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#xA0;</span>A nation which you don&#x2019;t know will eat the fruit of your ground and all of your work.

He will be the head, and you will be the tail. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#xA0;</span>All these curses will come on you, and will pursue you and overtake you, until you are destroyed, because you didn&#x2019;t listen to the LORD your God&#x2019;s voice, to keep his commandments and his statutes which he commanded you.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#xA0;</span>They will be for a sign and for a wonder to you and to your offspring forever.  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#xA0;</span>Because you didn&#x2019;t serve the LORD your God with joyfulness and with gladness of heart, by reason of the abundance of all things;  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#xA0;</span>therefore you will serve your enemies whom the LORD sends against you, in hunger, in thirst, in nakedness, and in lack of all things. He will put an iron yoke on your neck until he has destroyed you.  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#xA0;</span>The LORD will bring a nation against you from far away, from the end of the earth, as the eagle flies: a nation whose language you will not understand,  <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#xA0;</span>a nation of fierce facial expressions, that doesn&#x2019;t respect the elderly, nor show favour to the young.  <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#xA0;</span>They will eat the fruit of your livestock and the fruit of your ground, until you are destroyed. They also won&#x2019;t leave you grain, new wine, oil, the increase of your livestock, or the young of your flock, until they have caused you to perish.  <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#xA0;</span>They will besiege you in all your gates until your high and fortified walls in which you trusted come down throughout all your land. They will besiege you in all your gates throughout all your land which the LORD your God has given you.  <span class="verse" id="V53">53&#xA0;</span>You will eat the fruit of your own body, the flesh of your sons and of your daughters, whom the LORD your God has given you, in the siege and in the distress with which your enemies will distress you.  <span class="verse" id="V54">54&#xA0;</span>The man who is tender amongst you, and very delicate, his eye will be evil towards his brother, towards the wife whom he loves, and towards the remnant of his children whom he has remaining,  <span class="verse" id="V55">55&#xA0;</span>so that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his children whom he will eat, because he has nothing left to him, in the siege and in the distress with which your enemy will distress you in all your gates.  <span class="verse" id="V56">56&#xA0;</span>The tender and delicate woman amongst you, who would not venture to set the sole of her foot on the ground for delicateness and tenderness, her eye will be evil towards the husband that she loves, towards her son, towards her daughter,  <span class="verse" id="V57">57&#xA0;</span>towards her young one who comes out from between her feet, and towards her children whom she bears; for she will eat them secretly for lack of all things in the siege and in the distress with which your enemy will distress you in your gates.  <span class="verse" id="V58">58&#xA0;</span>If you will not observe to do all the words of this law that are written in this book, that you may fear this glorious and fearful name, THE LORD your God,  <span class="verse" id="V59">59&#xA0;</span>then the LORD will make your plagues and the plagues of your offspring fearful, even great plagues, and of long duration, and severe sicknesses, and of long duration.  <span class="verse" id="V60">60&#xA0;</span>He will bring on you again all the diseases of Egypt, which you were afraid of; and they will cling to you.  <span class="verse" id="V61">61&#xA0;</span>Also every sickness and every plague which is not written in the book of this law, the LORD will bring them on you until you are destroyed.  <span class="verse" id="V62">62&#xA0;</span>You will be left few in number, even though you were as the stars of the sky for multitude, because you didn&#x2019;t listen to the LORD your God&#x2019;s voice.  <span class="verse" id="V63">63&#xA0;</span>It will happen that as the LORD rejoiced over you to do you good, and to multiply you, so the LORD will rejoice over you to cause you to perish and to destroy you. You will be plucked from the land that you are going in to possess.  <span class="verse" id="V64">64&#xA0;</span>The LORD will scatter you amongst all peoples, from one end of the earth to the other end of the earth. There you will serve other gods which you have not known, you nor your fathers, even wood and stone.  <span class="verse" id="V65">65&#xA0;</span>Amongst these nations you will find no ease, and there will be no rest for the sole of your foot; but the LORD will give you there a trembling heart, failing of eyes, and pining of soul.  <span class="verse" id="V66">66&#xA0;</span>Your life will hang in doubt before you. You will be afraid night and day, and will have no assurance of your life.  <span class="verse" id="V67">67&#xA0;</span>In the morning you will say, &#x201C;I wish it were evening!&#x201D; and at evening you will say, &#x201C;I wish it were morning!&#x201D; for the fear of your heart which you will fear, and for the sights which your eyes will see.  <span class="verse" id="V68">68&#xA0;</span>The LORD will bring you into Egypt again with ships, by the way of which I told to you that you would never see it again. There you will offer yourselves to your enemies for male and female slaves, and nobody will buy you. </div>
