However he didn&#x2019;t enter into the LORD&#x2019;s temple. The people still acted corruptly.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#xA0;</span>He built the upper gate of the LORD&#x2019;s house, and he built much on the wall of Ophel.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#xA0;</span>Moreover he built cities in the hill country of Judah, and in the forests he built fortresses and towers.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#xA0;</span>He also fought with the king of the children of Ammon, and prevailed against them.
