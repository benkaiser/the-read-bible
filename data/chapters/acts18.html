He came to them,  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#xA0;</span>and because he practised the same trade, he lived with them and worked, for by trade they were tent makers.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#xA0;</span>He reasoned in the synagogue every Sabbath and persuaded Jews and Greeks. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#xA0;</span>When Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul was compelled by the Spirit, testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#xA0;</span>When they opposed him and blasphemed, he shook out his clothing and said to them, &#x201C;Your blood be on your own heads! I am clean. From now on, I will go to the Gentiles!&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#xA0;</span>He departed there and went into the house of a certain man named Justus, one who worshipped God, whose house was next door to the synagogue.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#xA0;</span>Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed in the Lord with all his house. Many of the Corinthians, when they heard, believed and were baptised.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#xA0;</span>The Lord said to Paul in the night by a vision, <span class="wj">&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t be afraid, but speak and don&#x2019;t be silent; </span>  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#xA0;</span> <span class="wj">for I am with you, and no one will attack you to harm you, for I have many people in this city.&#x201D;</span> </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#xA0;</span>He lived there a year and six months, teaching the word of God amongst them.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#xA0;</span>But when Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews with one accord rose up against Paul and brought him before the judgement seat,  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#xA0;</span>saying, &#x201C;This man persuades men to worship God contrary to the law.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#xA0;</span>But when Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, &#x201C;If indeed it were a matter of wrong or of wicked crime, you Jews, it would be reasonable that I should bear with you;  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#xA0;</span>but if they are questions about words and names and your own law, look to it yourselves. For I don&#x2019;t want to be a judge of these matters.&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#xA0;</span>So he drove them from the judgement seat. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#xA0;</span>Then all the Greeks seized Sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgement seat. Gallio didn&#x2019;t care about any of these things. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#xA0;</span>Paul, having stayed after this many more days, took his leave of the brothers,<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> The word for &#x201C;brothers&#x201D; here and where the context allows may also be correctly translated &#x201C;brothers and sisters&#x201D; or &#x201C;siblings.&#x201D;</span></a> and sailed from there for Syria, together with Priscilla and Aquila. He shaved his head in Cenchreae, for he had a vow.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#xA0;</span>He came to Ephesus, and he left them there; but he himself entered into the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#xA0;</span>When they asked him to stay with them a longer time, he declined;  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#xA0;</span>but taking his leave of them, he said, &#x201C;I must by all means keep this coming feast in Jerusalem, but I will return again to you if God wills.&#x201D; Then he set sail from Ephesus. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#xA0;</span>When he had landed at Caesarea, he went up and greeted the assembly, and went down to Antioch.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#xA0;</span>Having spent some time there, he departed and went through the region of Galatia and Phrygia, in order, establishing all the disciples.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#xA0;</span>Now a certain Jew named Apollos, an Alexandrian by race, an eloquent man, came to Ephesus. He was mighty in the Scriptures.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#xA0;</span>This man had been instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in spirit, he spoke and taught accurately the things concerning Jesus, although he knew only the baptism of John.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#xA0;</span>He began to speak boldly in the synagogue. But when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him aside, and explained to him the way of God more accurately. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#xA0;</span>When he had determined to pass over into Achaia, the brothers encouraged him; and wrote to the disciples to receive him. When he had come, he greatly helped those who had believed through grace;  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#xA0;</span>for he powerfully refuted the Jews, publicly showing by the Scriptures that Jesus was the Christ. </div>
