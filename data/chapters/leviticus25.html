You shall not sow your field or prune your vineyard.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#xA0;</span>What grows of itself in your harvest you shall not reap, and you shall not gather the grapes of your undressed vine. It shall be a year of solemn rest for the land.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#xA0;</span>The Sabbath of the land shall be for food for you; for yourself, for your servant, for your maid, for your hired servant, and for your stranger, who lives as a foreigner with you.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#xA0;</span>For your livestock also, and for the animals that are in your land, shall all its increase be for food. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#xA0;</span>&#x201C;&#xA0;&#x2018;You shall count off seven Sabbaths of years, seven times seven years; and there shall be to you the days of seven Sabbaths of years, even forty-nine years.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#xA0;</span>Then you shall sound the loud trumpet on the tenth day of the seventh month. On the Day of Atonement you shall sound the trumpet throughout all your land.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#xA0;</span>You shall make the fiftieth year holy, and proclaim liberty throughout the land to all its inhabitants.
