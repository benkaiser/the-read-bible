They gave no portion to the Levites in the land, except cities to dwell in, with their pasture lands for their livestock and for their property.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#xA0;</span>The children of Israel did as the LORD commanded Moses, and they divided the land. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#xA0;</span>Then the children of Judah came near to Joshua in Gilgal. Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said to him, &#x201C;You know the thing that the LORD spoke to Moses the man of God concerning me and concerning you in Kadesh Barnea.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#xA0;</span>I was forty years old when Moses the servant of the LORD sent me from Kadesh Barnea to spy out the land. I brought him word again as it was in my heart.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#xA0;</span>Nevertheless, my brothers who went up with me made the heart of the people melt; but I wholly followed the LORD my God.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#xA0;</span>Moses swore on that day, saying, &#x2018;Surely the land where you walked shall be an inheritance to you and to your children forever, because you have wholly followed the LORD my God.&#x2019; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#xA0;</span>&#x201C;Now, behold, the LORD has kept me alive, as he spoke, these forty-five years, from the time that the LORD spoke this word to Moses, while Israel walked in the wilderness. Now, behold, I am eighty-five years old, today.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#xA0;</span>As yet I am as strong today as I was in the day that Moses sent me. As my strength was then, even so is my strength now for war, to go out and to come in.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#xA0;</span>Now therefore give me this hill country, of which the LORD spoke in that day; for you heard in that day how the Anakim were there, and great and fortified cities. It may be that the LORD will be with me, and I shall drive them out, as the LORD said.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#xA0;</span>Joshua blessed him; and he gave Hebron to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for an inheritance.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#xA0;</span>Therefore Hebron became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite to this day, because he followed the LORD, the God of Israel wholeheartedly.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#xA0;</span>Now the name of Hebron before was Kiriath Arba, after the greatest man amongst the Anakim. Then the land had rest from war. </div>
