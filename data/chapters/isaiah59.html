eggs </div><div class="q2">and weave the spider&#x2019;s web. </div><div class="q">He who eats of their eggs dies; </div><div class="q2">and that which is crushed breaks out into a viper. </div><div class="q"> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#xA0;</span>Their webs won&#x2019;t become garments. </div><div class="q2">They won&#x2019;t cover themselves with their works. </div><div class="q">Their works are works of iniquity, </div><div class="q2">and acts of violence are in their hands. </div><div class="q"> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#xA0;</span>Their feet run to evil, </div><div class="q2">and they hurry to shed innocent blood. </div><div class="q">Their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity. </div><div class="q2">Desolation and destruction are in their paths. </div><div class="q"> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#xA0;</span>They don&#x2019;t know the way of peace; </div><div class="q2">and there is no justice in their ways. </div><div class="q">They have made crooked paths for themselves; </div><div class="q2">whoever goes in them doesn&#x2019;t know peace. </div><div class="b"> &#xA0; </div><div class="q"> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#xA0;</span>Therefore justice is far from us, </div><div class="q2">and righteousness doesn&#x2019;t overtake us. </div><div class="q">We look for light, but see darkness; </div><div class="q2">for brightness, but we walk in obscurity. </div><div class="q"> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#xA0;</span>We grope for the wall like the blind. </div><div class="q2">Yes, we grope as those who have no eyes. </div><div class="q">We stumble at noon as if it were twilight. </div><div class="q2">Amongst those who are strong, we are like dead men. </div><div class="q"> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#xA0;</span>We all roar like bears </div><div class="q2">and moan sadly like doves. </div><div class="q">We look for justice, but there is none, </div><div class="q2">for salvation, but it is far off from us. </div><div class="b"> &#xA0; </div><div class="q"> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#xA0;</span>For our transgressions are multiplied before you, </div><div class="q2">and our sins testify against us; </div><div class="q">for our transgressions are with us, </div><div class="q2">and as for our iniquities, we know them: </div><div class="q"> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#xA0;</span>transgressing and denying the LORD, </div><div class="q2">and turning away from following our God, </div><div class="q2">speaking oppression and revolt, </div><div class="q2">conceiving and uttering from the heart words of falsehood. </div><div class="q"> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#xA0;</span>Justice is turned away backward, </div><div class="q2">and righteousness stands far away; </div><div class="q">for truth has fallen in the street, </div><div class="q2">and uprightness can&#x2019;t enter. </div><div class="q"> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#xA0;</span>Yes, truth is lacking; </div><div class="q2">and he who departs from evil makes himself a prey. </div><div class="b"> &#xA0; </div><div class="q">The LORD saw it, </div><div class="q2">and it displeased him that there was no justice. </div><div class="q"> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#xA0;</span>He saw that there was no man, </div><div class="q2">and wondered that there was no intercessor. </div><div class="q">Therefore his own arm brought salvation to him; </div><div class="q2">and his righteousness sustained him. </div><div class="q"> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#xA0;</span>He put on righteousness as a breastplate, </div><div class="q2">and a helmet of salvation on his head. </div><div class="q">He put on garments of vengeance for clothing, </div><div class="q2">and was clad with zeal as a mantle. </div><div class="q"> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#xA0;</span>According to their deeds, </div><div class="q2">he will repay as appropriate: </div><div class="q2">wrath to his adversaries, </div><div class="q2">recompense to his enemies. </div><div class="q2">He will repay the islands their due. </div><div class="q"> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#xA0;</span>So they will fear the LORD&#x2019;s name from the west, </div><div class="q2">and his glory from the rising of the sun; </div><div class="q">for he will come as a rushing stream, </div><div class="q2">which the LORD&#x2019;s breath drives. </div><div class="b"> &#xA0; </div><div class="q"> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#xA0;</span>&#x201C;A Redeemer will come to Zion, </div><div class="q2">and to those who turn from disobedience in Jacob,&#x201D; says the LORD. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#xA0;</span>&#x201C;As for me, this is my covenant with them,&#x201D; says the LORD. &#x201C;My Spirit who is on you, and my words which I have put in your mouth shall not depart out of your mouth, nor out of the mouth of your offspring, nor out of the mouth of your offspring&#x2019;s offspring,&#x201D;
