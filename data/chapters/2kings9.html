Then he said, &#x201C;I have a message for you, captain.&#x201D; </div><div class="p">Jehu said, &#x201C;To which one of us?&#x201D; </div><div class="p">He said, &#x201C;To you, O captain.&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#xA0;</span>He arose, and went into the house. Then he poured the oil on his head, and said to him, &#x201C;The LORD, the God of Israel, says, &#x2018;I have anointed you king over the people of the LORD, even over Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#xA0;</span>You must strike your master Ahab&#x2019;s house, that I may avenge the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of the LORD, at the hand of Jezebel.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#xA0;</span>For the whole house of Ahab will perish. I will cut off from Ahab everyone who urinates against a wall,<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> or, male</span></a> both him who is shut up and him who is left at large in Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#xA0;</span>I will make Ahab&#x2019;s house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#xA0;</span>The dogs will eat Jezebel on the plot of ground of Jezreel, and there shall be no one to bury her.&#x2019;&#xA0;&#x201D; Then he opened the door and fled. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#xA0;</span>When Jehu came out to the servants of his lord and one said to him, &#x201C;Is all well? Why did this madman come to you?&#x201D; </div><div class="p">He said to them, &#x201C;You know the man and how he talks.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#xA0;</span>They said, &#x201C;That is a lie. Tell us now.&#x201D; </div><div class="p">He said, &#x201C;He said to me, &#x2018;The LORD says, I have anointed you king over Israel.&#x2019;&#xA0;&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#xA0;</span>Then they hurried, and each man took his cloak, and put it under him on the top of the stairs, and blew the trumpet, saying, &#x201C;Jehu is king.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#xA0;</span>So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired against Joram. (Now Joram was defending Ramoth Gilead, he and all Israel, because of Hazael king of Syria;  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#xA0;</span>but King Joram had returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him when he fought with Hazael king of Syria.) Jehu said, &#x201C;If this is your thinking, then let no one escape and go out of the city to go to tell it in Jezreel.&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#xA0;</span>So Jehu rode in a chariot and went to Jezreel, for Joram lay there. Ahaziah king of Judah had come down to see Joram.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#xA0;</span>Now the watchman was standing on the tower in Jezreel, and he spied the company of Jehu as he came, and said, &#x201C;I see a company.&#x201D; </div><div class="p">Joram said, &#x201C;Take a horseman, and send to meet them, and let him say, &#x2018;Is it peace?&#x2019;&#xA0;&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#xA0;</span>So one went on horseback to meet him, and said, &#x201C;the king says, &#x2018;Is it peace?&#x2019;&#xA0;&#x201D; </div><div class="p">Jehu said, &#x201C;What do you have to do with peace? Fall in behind me!&#x201D; </div><div class="p">The watchman said, &#x201C;The messenger came to them, but he isn&#x2019;t coming back.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#xA0;</span>Then he sent out a second on horseback, who came to them and said, &#x201C;The king says, &#x2018;Is it peace?&#x2019;&#xA0;&#x201D; </div><div class="p">Jehu answered, &#x201C;What do you have to do with peace? Fall in behind me!&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#xA0;</span>The watchman said, &#x201C;He came to them, and isn&#x2019;t coming back. The driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi, for he drives furiously.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#xA0;</span>Joram said, &#x201C;Get ready!&#x201D; </div><div class="p">They got his chariot ready. Then Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out, each in his chariot; and they went out to meet Jehu, and found him on Naboth the Jezreelite&#x2019;s land.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#xA0;</span>When Joram saw Jehu, he said, &#x201C;Is it peace, Jehu?&#x201D; </div><div class="p">He answered, &#x201C;What peace, so long as the prostitution of your mother Jezebel and her witchcraft abound?&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#xA0;</span>Joram turned his hands and fled, and said to Ahaziah, &#x201C;This is treason, Ahaziah!&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#xA0;</span>Jehu drew his bow with his full strength, and struck Joram between his arms; and the arrow went out at his heart, and he sunk down in his chariot.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#xA0;</span>Then Jehu said to Bidkar his captain, &#x201C;Pick him up, and throw him in the plot of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite; for remember how, when you and I rode together after Ahab his father, the LORD laid this burden on him:  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#xA0;</span>&#x2018;Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth, and the blood of his sons,&#x2019; says the LORD; &#x2018;and I will repay you in this plot of ground,&#x2019; says the LORD. Now therefore take and cast him onto the plot of ground, according to the LORD&#x2019;s word.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#xA0;</span>But when Ahaziah the king of Judah saw this, he fled by the way of the garden house. Jehu followed after him, and said, &#x201C;Strike him also in the chariot!&#x201D; They struck him at the ascent of Gur, which is by Ibleam. He fled to Megiddo, and died there.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#xA0;</span>His servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and buried him in his tomb with his fathers in David&#x2019;s city.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#xA0;</span>In the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab, Ahaziah began to reign over Judah. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#xA0;</span>When Jehu had come to Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it; and she painted her eyes, and adorned her head, and looked out at the window.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#xA0;</span>As Jehu entered in at the gate, she said, &#x201C;Do you come in peace, Zimri, you murderer of your master?&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#xA0;</span>He lifted up his face to the window, and said, &#x201C;Who is on my side? Who?&#x201D; </div><div class="p">Two or three eunuchs looked out at him. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#xA0;</span>He said, &#x201C;Throw her down!&#x201D; </div><div class="p">So they threw her down; and some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall, and on the horses. Then he trampled her under foot.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#xA0;</span>When he had come in, he ate and drank. Then he said, &#x201C;See now to this cursed woman, and bury her; for she is a king&#x2019;s daughter.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#xA0;</span>They went to bury her, but they found no more of her than the skull, the feet, and the palms of her hands.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#xA0;</span>Therefore they came back, and told him. </div><div class="p">He said, &#x201C;This is the LORD&#x2019;s word, which he spoke by his servant Elijah the Tishbite, saying, &#x2018;The dogs will eat the flesh of Jezebel on the plot of Jezreel,  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#xA0;</span>and the body of Jezebel will be as dung on the surface of the field on Jezreel&#x2019;s land, so that they won&#x2019;t say, &#x201C;This is Jezebel.&#x201D;&#xA0;&#x2019;&#xA0;&#x201D; </div>
