They obeyed and let them go,  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#xA0;</span>but afterwards they turned, and caused the servants and the handmaids whom they had let go free to return, and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#xA0;</span>Therefore the LORD&#x2019;s word came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#xA0;</span>&#x201C;The LORD, the God of Israel, says: &#x2018;I made a covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage, saying:  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#xA0;</span>At the end of seven years, every man of you shall release his brother who is a Hebrew, who has been sold to you, and has served you six years. You shall let him go free from you. But your fathers didn&#x2019;t listen to me, and didn&#x2019;t incline their ear.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#xA0;</span>You had now turned, and had done that which is right in my eyes, in every man proclaiming liberty to his neighbour. You had made a covenant before me in the house which is called by my name;  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#xA0;</span>but you turned and profaned my name, and every man caused his servant and every man his handmaid, whom you had let go free at their pleasure, to return. You brought them into subjection, to be to you for servants and for handmaids.&#x2019;&#xA0;&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#xA0;</span>Therefore the LORD says: &#x201C;You have not listened to me, to proclaim liberty, every man to his brother, and every man to his neighbour.

I will make you be tossed back and forth amongst all the kingdoms of the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#xA0;</span>I will give the men who have transgressed my covenant, who have not performed the words of the covenant which they made before me when they cut the calf in two and passed between its parts:  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#xA0;</span>the princes of Judah, the princes of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, the priests, and all the people of the land, who passed between the parts of the calf.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#xA0;</span>I will even give them into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of those who seek their life.
