Go down there, and buy for us from there, so that we may live, and not die.&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#xA0;</span>Joseph&#x2019;s ten brothers went down to buy grain from Egypt.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#xA0;</span>But Jacob didn&#x2019;t send Benjamin, Joseph&#x2019;s brother, with his brothers; for he said, &#x201C;Lest perhaps harm happen to him.&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#xA0;</span>The sons of Israel came to buy amongst those who came, for the famine was in the land of Canaan.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#xA0;</span>Joseph was the governor over the land. It was he who sold to all the people of the land. Joseph&#x2019;s brothers came, and bowed themselves down to him with their faces to the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#xA0;</span>Joseph saw his brothers, and he recognised them, but acted like a stranger to them, and spoke roughly with them.

By the life of Pharaoh, you shall not go out from here, unless your youngest brother comes here.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#xA0;</span>Send one of you, and let him get your brother, and you shall be bound, that your words may be tested, whether there is truth in you, or else by the life of Pharaoh surely you are spies.&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#xA0;</span>He put them all together into custody for three days. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#xA0;</span>Joseph said to them the third day, &#x201C;Do this, and live, for I fear God.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#xA0;</span>If you are honest men, then let one of your brothers be bound in your prison; but you go, carry grain for the famine of your houses.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#xA0;</span>Bring your youngest brother to me; so will your words be verified, and you won&#x2019;t die.&#x201D; </div><div class="p">They did so.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#xA0;</span>They said to one another, &#x201C;We are certainly guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the distress of his soul, when he begged us, and we wouldn&#x2019;t listen. Therefore this distress has come upon us.&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#xA0;</span>Reuben answered them, saying, &#x201C;Didn&#x2019;t I tell you, saying, &#x2018;Don&#x2019;t sin against the child,&#x2019; and you wouldn&#x2019;t listen?

Then he returned to them, and spoke to them, and took Simeon from amongst them, and bound him before their eyes.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#xA0;</span>Then Joseph gave a command to fill their bags with grain, and to restore each man&#x2019;s money into his sack, and to give them food for the way.

Behold, it is in my sack!&#x201D; Their hearts failed them, and they turned trembling to one another, saying, &#x201C;What is this that God has done to us?&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#xA0;</span>They came to Jacob their father, to the land of Canaan, and told him all that had happened to them, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#xA0;</span>&#x201C;The man, the lord of the land, spoke roughly with us, and took us for spies of the country.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#xA0;</span>We said to him, &#x2018;We are honest men.
