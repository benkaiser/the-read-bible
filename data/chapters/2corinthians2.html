For if indeed I have forgiven anything, I have forgiven that one for your sakes in the presence of Christ,  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#xA0;</span>that no advantage may be gained over us by Satan, for we are not ignorant of his schemes. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#xA0;</span>Now when I came to Troas for the Good News of Christ, and when a door was opened to me in the Lord,  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#xA0;</span>I had no relief for my spirit, because I didn&#x2019;t find Titus my brother, but taking my leave of them, I went out into Macedonia. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#xA0;</span>Now thanks be to God who always leads us in triumph in Christ, and reveals through us the sweet aroma of his knowledge in every place.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#xA0;</span>For we are a sweet aroma of Christ to God in those who are saved and in those who perish:  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#xA0;</span>to the one a stench from death to death, to the other a sweet aroma from life to life. Who is sufficient for these things?  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#xA0;</span>For we are not as so many, peddling the word of God. But as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God, we speak in Christ. </div>
