He lit its lamps to light the area in front of the lamp stand, as the LORD commanded Moses.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#xA0;</span>This was the workmanship of the lamp stand, beaten work of gold. From its base to its flowers, it was beaten work. He made the lamp stand according to the pattern which the LORD had shown Moses. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#xA0;</span>The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#xA0;</span>&#x201C;Take the Levites from amongst the children of Israel, and cleanse them.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#xA0;</span>You shall do this to them to cleanse them: sprinkle the water of cleansing on them, let them shave their whole bodies with a razor, let them wash their clothes, and cleanse themselves.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#xA0;</span>Then let them take a young bull and its meal offering, fine flour mixed with oil; and another young bull you shall take for a sin offering.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#xA0;</span>You shall present the Levites before the Tent of Meeting. You shall assemble the whole congregation of the children of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#xA0;</span>You shall present the Levites before the LORD. The children of Israel shall lay their hands on the Levites,  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#xA0;</span>and Aaron shall offer the Levites before the LORD for a wave offering on the behalf of the children of Israel, that it may be theirs to do the service of the LORD. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#xA0;</span>&#x201C;The Levites shall lay their hands on the heads of the bulls, and you shall offer the one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering to the LORD, to make atonement for the Levites.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#xA0;</span>You shall set the Levites before Aaron and before his sons, and offer them as a wave offering to the LORD.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#xA0;</span>Thus you shall separate the Levites from amongst the children of Israel, and the Levites shall be mine. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#xA0;</span>&#x201C;After that, the Levites shall go in to do the service of the Tent of Meeting. You shall cleanse them, and offer them as a wave offering.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#xA0;</span>For they are wholly given to me from amongst the children of Israel; instead of all who open the womb, even the firstborn of all the children of Israel, I have taken them to me.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#xA0;</span>For all the firstborn amongst the children of Israel are mine, both man and animal. On the day that I struck all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, I sanctified them for myself.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#xA0;</span>I have taken the Levites instead of all the firstborn amongst the children of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#xA0;</span>I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and to his sons from amongst the children of Israel, to do the service of the children of Israel in the Tent of Meeting, and to make atonement for the children of Israel, so that there will be no plague amongst the children of Israel when the children of Israel come near to the sanctuary.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#xA0;</span>Moses, and Aaron, and all the congregation of the children of Israel did so to the Levites.
