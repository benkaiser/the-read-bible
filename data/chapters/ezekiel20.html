They didn&#x2019;t all throw away the abominations of their eyes. They also didn&#x2019;t forsake the idols of Egypt. Then I said I would pour out my wrath on them, to accomplish my anger against them in the middle of the land of Egypt.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#xA0;</span>But I worked for my name&#x2019;s sake, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations amongst which they were, in whose sight I made myself known to them in bringing them out of the land of Egypt.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#xA0;</span>So I caused them to go out of the land of Egypt and brought them into the wilderness.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#xA0;</span>I gave them my statutes and showed them my ordinances, which if a man does, he will live in them.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#xA0;</span>Moreover also I gave them my Sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am the LORD who sanctifies them. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#xA0;</span>&#x201C;&#xA0;&#x2018;&#xA0;&#x201C;But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness.

Then I said I would pour out my wrath on them, to accomplish my anger against them in the wilderness.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#xA0;</span>Nevertheless I withdrew my hand and worked for my name&#x2019;s sake, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, in whose sight I brought them out.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#xA0;</span>Moreover I swore to them in the wilderness, that I would scatter them amongst the nations and disperse them through the countries,  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#xA0;</span>because they had not executed my ordinances, but had rejected my statutes, and had profaned my Sabbaths, and their eyes were after their fathers&#x2019; idols.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#xA0;</span>Moreover also I gave them statutes that were not good, and ordinances in which they couldn&#x2019;t live.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#xA0;</span>I polluted them in their own gifts, in that they caused all that opens the womb to pass through the fire, that I might make them desolate, to the end that they might know that I am the LORD.&#x201D;&#xA0;&#x2019; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#xA0;</span>&#x201C;Therefore, son of man, speak to the house of Israel, and tell them, &#x2018;The Lord GOD says: &#x201C;Moreover, in this your fathers have blasphemed me, in that they have committed a trespass against me.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#xA0;</span>For when I had brought them into the land which I swore to give to them, then they saw every high hill and every thick tree, and they offered there their sacrifices, and there they presented the provocation of their offering.
