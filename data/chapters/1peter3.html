Thus, while you are spoken against as evildoers, they may be disappointed who curse your good way of life in Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#xA0;</span>For it is better, if it is God&#x2019;s will, that you suffer for doing what is right than for doing evil.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#xA0;</span>Because Christ also suffered for sins once, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring you to God, being put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the Spirit,  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#xA0;</span>in whom he also went and preached to the spirits in prison,  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#xA0;</span>who before were disobedient when God waited patiently in the days of Noah while the ship was being built. In it, few, that is, eight souls, were saved through water.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#xA0;</span>This is a symbol of baptism, which now saves you&#x2014;not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience towards God&#x2014;through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#xA0;</span>who is at the right hand of God, having gone into heaven, angels and authorities and powers being made subject to him. </div>
