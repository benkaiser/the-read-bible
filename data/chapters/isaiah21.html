The treacherous man deals treacherously, and the destroyer destroys. Go up, Elam; attack! I have stopped all of Media&#x2019;s sighing.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#xA0;</span>Therefore my thighs are filled with anguish. Pains have seized me, like the pains of a woman in labour. I am in so much pain that I can&#x2019;t hear. I am so dismayed that I can&#x2019;t see.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#xA0;</span>My heart flutters. Horror has frightened me. The twilight that I desired has been turned into trembling for me.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#xA0;</span>They prepare the table. They set the watch. They eat. They drink. Rise up, you princes, oil the shield!  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#xA0;</span>For the Lord said to me, &#x201C;Go, set a watchman. Let him declare what he sees.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#xA0;</span>When he sees a troop, horsemen in pairs, a troop of donkeys, a troop of camels, he shall listen diligently with great attentiveness.&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#xA0;</span>He cried like a lion: &#x201C;Lord, I stand continually on the watchtower in the daytime, and every night I stay at my post.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#xA0;</span>Behold, here comes a troop of men, horsemen in pairs.&#x201D; He answered, &#x201C;Fallen, fallen is Babylon; and all the engraved images of her gods are broken to the ground. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#xA0;</span>You are my threshing, and the grain of my floor!&#x201D; That which I have heard from the LORD of Armies, the God of Israel, I have declared to you. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#xA0;</span>The burden of Dumah. </div><div class="p">One calls to me out of Seir, &#x201C;Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of the night?&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#xA0;</span>The watchman said, &#x201C;The morning comes, and also the night. If you will enquire, enquire. Come back again.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#xA0;</span>The burden on Arabia. </div><div class="p">You will lodge in the thickets in Arabia, you caravans of Dedanites.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#xA0;</span>They brought water to him who was thirsty. The inhabitants of the land of Tema met the fugitives with their bread.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#xA0;</span>For they fled away from the swords, from the drawn sword, from the bent bow, and from the heat of battle.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#xA0;</span>For the Lord said to me, &#x201C;Within a year, as a worker bound by contract would count it, all the glory of Kedar will fail,  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#xA0;</span>and the residue of the number of the archers, the mighty men of the children of Kedar, will be few; for the LORD, the God of Israel, has spoken it.&#x201D; </div>
