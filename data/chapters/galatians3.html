Having begun in the Spirit, are you now completed in the flesh?  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#xA0;</span>Did you suffer so many things in vain, if it is indeed in vain?  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#xA0;</span>He therefore who supplies the Spirit to you and does miracles amongst you, does he do it by the works of the law, or by hearing of faith?  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#xA0;</span>Even so, Abraham &#x201C;believed God, and it was counted to him for righteousness.&#x201D;<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">&#x2721;<span class="popup"> Genesis 15:6</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#xA0;</span>Know therefore that those who are of faith are children of Abraham.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#xA0;</span>The Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the Good News beforehand to Abraham, saying, &#x201C;In you all the nations will be blessed.&#x201D;<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">&#x2721;<span class="popup"> Genesis 12:3; 18:18; 22:18</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#xA0;</span>So then, those who are of faith are blessed with the faithful Abraham. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#xA0;</span>For as many as are of the works of the law are under a curse.

It was added because of transgressions, until the offspring should come to whom the promise has been made.

Certainly not! For if there had been a law given which could make alive, most certainly righteousness would have been of the law.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#xA0;</span>But the Scripture imprisoned all things under sin, that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#xA0;</span>But before faith came, we were kept in custody under the law, confined for the faith which should afterwards be revealed.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#xA0;</span>So that the law has become our tutor to bring us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#xA0;</span>But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#xA0;</span>For you are all children of God, through faith in Christ Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#xA0;</span>For as many of you as were baptised into Christ have put on Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#xA0;</span>There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free man, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#xA0;</span>If you are Christ&#x2019;s, then you are Abraham&#x2019;s offspring and heirs according to promise. </div>
