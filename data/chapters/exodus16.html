Your murmurings are not against us, but against the LORD.&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#xA0;</span>Moses said to Aaron, &#x201C;Tell all the congregation of the children of Israel, &#x2018;Come close to the LORD, for he has heard your murmurings.&#x2019;&#xA0;&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#xA0;</span>As Aaron spoke to the whole congregation of the children of Israel, they looked towards the wilderness, and behold, the LORD&#x2019;s glory appeared in the cloud.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#xA0;</span>The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#xA0;</span>&#x201C;I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel. Speak to them, saying, &#x2018;At evening you shall eat meat, and in the morning you shall be filled with bread.

Moses said to them, &#x201C;It is the bread which the LORD has given you to eat.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#xA0;</span>This is the thing which the LORD has commanded: &#x2018;Gather of it everyone according to his eating; an omer<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> An omer is about 2.2 litres or about 2.3 quarts</span></a> a head, according to the number of your persons, you shall take it, every man for those who are in his tent.&#x2019;&#xA0;&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#xA0;</span>The children of Israel did so, and some gathered more, some less.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#xA0;</span>When they measured it with an omer, he who gathered much had nothing over, and he who gathered little had no lack. They each gathered according to his eating.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#xA0;</span>Moses said to them, &#x201C;Let no one leave of it until the morning.&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#xA0;</span>Notwithstanding they didn&#x2019;t listen to Moses, but some of them left of it until the morning, so it bred worms and became foul; and Moses was angry with them.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#xA0;</span>They gathered it morning by morning, everyone according to his eating. When the sun grew hot, it melted.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#xA0;</span>On the sixth day, they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for each one; and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#xA0;</span>He said to them, &#x201C;This is that which the LORD has spoken, &#x2018;Tomorrow is a solemn rest, a holy Sabbath to the LORD. Bake that which you want to bake, and boil that which you want to boil; and all that remains over lay up for yourselves to be kept until the morning.&#x2019;&#xA0;&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#xA0;</span>They laid it up until the morning, as Moses ordered, and it didn&#x2019;t become foul, and there were no worms in it.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#xA0;</span>Moses said, &#x201C;Eat that today, for today is a Sabbath to the LORD. Today you shall not find it in the field.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#xA0;</span>Six days you shall gather it, but on the seventh day is the Sabbath. In it there shall be none.&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#xA0;</span>On the seventh day, some of the people went out to gather, and they found none.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#xA0;</span>The LORD said to Moses, &#x201C;How long do you refuse to keep my commandments and my laws?  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#xA0;</span>Behold, because the LORD has given you the Sabbath, therefore he gives you on the sixth day the bread of two days. Everyone stay in his place. Let no one go out of his place on the seventh day.&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#xA0;</span>So the people rested on the seventh day. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#xA0;</span>The house of Israel called its name &#x201C;Manna&#x201D;,<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">&#x2020;<span class="popup"> &#x201C;Manna&#x201D; means &#x201C;What is it?&#x201D;</span></a> and it was like coriander seed, white; and its taste was like wafers with honey.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#xA0;</span>Moses said, &#x201C;This is the thing which the LORD has commanded, &#x2018;Let an omer-full of it be kept throughout your generations, that they may see the bread with which I fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you out of the land of Egypt.&#x2019;&#xA0;&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#xA0;</span>Moses said to Aaron, &#x201C;Take a pot, and put an omer-full of manna in it, and lay it up before the LORD, to be kept throughout your generations.&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#xA0;</span>As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#xA0;</span>The children of Israel ate the manna forty years, until they came to an inhabited land.
