The waters came down from underneath, from the right side of the temple, on the south of the altar.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#xA0;</span>Then he brought me out by the way of the gate northward, and led me around by the way outside to the outer gate, by the way of the gate that looks towards the east. Behold, waters ran out on the right side. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#xA0;</span>When the man went out eastward with the line in his hand, he measured one thousand cubits,<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> A cubit is the length from the tip of the middle finger to the elbow on a man&#x2019;s arm, or about 18 inches or 46 centimetres.</span></a> and he caused me to pass through the waters, waters that were to the ankles.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#xA0;</span>Again he measured one thousand, and caused me to pass through the waters, waters that were to the knees. Again he measured one thousand, and caused me to pass through waters that were to the waist.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#xA0;</span>Afterward he measured one thousand; and it was a river that I could not pass through, for the waters had risen, waters to swim in, a river that could not be walked through. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#xA0;</span>He said to me, &#x201C;Son of man, have you seen this?&#x201D; </div><div class="p">Then he brought me and caused me to return to the bank of the river.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#xA0;</span>Now when I had returned, behold, on the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#xA0;</span>Then he said to me, &#x201C;These waters flow out towards the eastern region and will go down into the Arabah. Then they will go towards the sea and flow into the sea which will be made to flow out; and the waters will be healed.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#xA0;</span>It will happen that every living creature which swarms, in every place where the rivers come, will live. Then there will be a very great multitude of fish; for these waters have come there, and the waters of the sea will be healed, and everything will live wherever the river comes.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#xA0;</span>It will happen that fishermen will stand by it. From En Gedi even to En Eglaim will be a place for the spreading of nets. Their fish will be after their kinds, as the fish of the great sea, exceedingly many.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#xA0;</span>But its swamps marshes will not be healed. They will be given up to salt.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#xA0;</span>By the river banks, on both sides, will grow every tree for food, whose leaf won&#x2019;t wither, neither will its fruit fail. It will produce new fruit every month, because its waters issue out of the sanctuary. Its fruit will be for food, and its leaf for healing.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#xA0;</span>The Lord GOD says: &#x201C;This shall be the border by which you shall divide the land for inheritance according to the twelve tribes of Israel.
