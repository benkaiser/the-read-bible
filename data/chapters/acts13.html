From there they sailed to Cyprus.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#xA0;</span>When they were at Salamis, they proclaimed God&#x2019;s word in the Jewish synagogues. They also had John as their attendant.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#xA0;</span>When they had gone through the island to Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew whose name was Bar Jesus,  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#xA0;</span>who was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, a man of understanding. This man summoned Barnabas and Saul, and sought to hear the word of God.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#xA0;</span>But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his name by interpretation) withstood them, seeking to turn the proconsul away from the faith.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#xA0;</span>But Saul, who is also called Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, fastened his eyes on him  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#xA0;</span>and said, &#x201C;You son of the devil, full of all deceit and all cunning, you enemy of all righteousness, will you not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord?  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#xA0;</span>Now, behold, the hand of the Lord is on you, and you will be blind, not seeing the sun for a season!&#x201D; </div><div class="p">Immediately a mist and darkness fell on him. He went around seeking someone to lead him by the hand.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#xA0;</span>Then the proconsul, when he saw what was done, believed, being astonished at the teaching of the Lord. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#xA0;</span>Now Paul and his company set sail from Paphos and came to Perga in Pamphylia. John departed from them and returned to Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#xA0;</span>But they, passing on from Perga, came to Antioch of Pisidia. They went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and sat down.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#xA0;</span>After the reading of the law and the prophets, the rulers of the synagogue sent to them, saying, &#x201C;Brothers, if you have any word of exhortation for the people, speak.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#xA0;</span>Paul stood up, and gesturing with his hand said, &#x201C;Men of Israel, and you who fear God, listen.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#xA0;</span>The God of this people<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> TR, NU add &#x201C;Israel&#x201D;</span></a> chose our fathers, and exalted the people when they stayed as aliens in the land of Egypt, and with an uplifted arm, he led them out of it.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#xA0;</span>For a period of about forty years he put up with them in the wilderness.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#xA0;</span>When he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, he gave them their land for an inheritance for about four hundred and fifty years.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#xA0;</span>After these things, he gave them judges until Samuel the prophet.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#xA0;</span>Afterward they asked for a king, and God gave to them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#xA0;</span>When he had removed him, he raised up David to be their king, to whom he also testified, &#x2018;I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after my heart, who will do all my will.&#x2019;  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#xA0;</span>From this man&#x2019;s offspring, God has brought salvation<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">&#x2020;<span class="popup"> TR, NU read &#x201C;a Saviour, Jesus&#x201D; instead of &#x201C;salvation&#x201D;</span></a> to Israel according to his promise,  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#xA0;</span>before his coming, when John had first preached the baptism of repentance to Israel.<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">&#x2021;<span class="popup"> TR, NU read &#x201C;to all the people of Israel&#x201D; instead of &#x201C;to Israel&#x201D;</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#xA0;</span>As John was fulfilling his course, he said, &#x2018;What do you suppose that I am?
