They will tell you, &#x2018;The donkeys which you went to look for have been found; and behold, your father has stopped caring about the donkeys and is anxious for you, saying, &#x201C;What shall I do for my son?&#x201D;&#xA0;&#x2019; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#xA0;</span>&#x201C;Then you will go on forward from there, and you will come to the oak of Tabor. Three men will meet you there going up to God to Bethel: one carrying three young goats, and another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a container of wine.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#xA0;</span>They will greet you and give you two loaves of bread, which you shall receive from their hand. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#xA0;</span>&#x201C;After that you will come to the hill of God, where the garrison of the Philistines is; and it will happen, when you have come there to the city, that you will meet a band of prophets coming down from the high place with a lute, a tambourine, a pipe, and a harp before them; and they will be prophesying.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#xA0;</span>Then the LORD&#x2019;s Spirit will come mightily on you, then you will prophesy with them and will be turned into another man.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#xA0;</span>Let it be, when these signs have come to you, that you do what is appropriate for the occasion; for God is with you. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#xA0;</span>&#x201C;Go down ahead of me to Gilgal; and behold, I will come down to you to offer burnt offerings and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings. Wait seven days, until I come to you and show you what you are to do.&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#xA0;</span>It was so, that when he had turned his back to go from Samuel, God gave him another heart; and all those signs happened that day.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#xA0;</span>When they came there to the hill, behold, a band of prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came mightily on him, and he prophesied amongst them.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#xA0;</span>When all who knew him before saw that, behold, he prophesied with the prophets, then the people said to one another, &#x201C;What is this that has come to the son of Kish? Is Saul also amongst the prophets?&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#xA0;</span>One from the same place answered, &#x201C;Who is their father?&#x201D; Therefore it became a proverb, &#x201C;Is Saul also amongst the prophets?&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#xA0;</span>When he had finished prophesying, he came to the high place. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#xA0;</span>Saul&#x2019;s uncle said to him and to his servant, &#x201C;Where did you go?&#x201D; </div><div class="p">He said, &#x201C;To seek the donkeys. When we saw that they were not found, we came to Samuel.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#xA0;</span>Saul&#x2019;s uncle said, &#x201C;Please tell me what Samuel said to you.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#xA0;</span>Saul said to his uncle, &#x201C;He told us plainly that the donkeys were found.&#x201D; But concerning the matter of the kingdom, of which Samuel spoke, he didn&#x2019;t tell him. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#xA0;</span>Samuel called the people together to the LORD to Mizpah;  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#xA0;</span>and he said to the children of Israel, &#x201C;The LORD, the God of Israel, says &#x2018;I brought Israel up out of Egypt and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all the kingdoms that oppressed you.&#x2019;  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#xA0;</span>But you have today rejected your God, who himself saves you out of all your calamities and your distresses; and you have said to him, &#x2018;No! Set a king over us!&#x2019; Now therefore present yourselves before the LORD by your tribes and by your thousands.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#xA0;</span>So Samuel brought all the tribes of Israel near, and the tribe of Benjamin was chosen.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#xA0;</span>He brought the tribe of Benjamin near by their families and the family of the Matrites was chosen. Then Saul the son of Kish was chosen; but when they looked for him, he could not be found.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#xA0;</span>Therefore they asked of the LORD further, &#x201C;Is there yet a man to come here?&#x201D; </div><div class="p">The LORD answered, &#x201C;Behold, he has hidden himself amongst the baggage.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#xA0;</span>They ran and got him there. When he stood amongst the people, he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#xA0;</span>Samuel said to all the people, &#x201C;Do you see him whom the LORD has chosen, that there is no one like him amongst all the people?&#x201D; </div><div class="p">All the people shouted and said, &#x201C;Long live the king!&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#xA0;</span>Then Samuel told the people the regulations of the kingdom, and wrote it in a book and laid it up before the LORD. Samuel sent all the people away, every man to his house.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#xA0;</span>Saul also went to his house in Gibeah; and the army went with him, whose hearts God had touched.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#xA0;</span>But certain worthless fellows said, &#x201C;How could this man save us?&#x201D; They despised him, and brought him no tribute. But he held his peace. </div>
