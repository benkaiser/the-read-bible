What do you think?&#x201D; They all condemned him to be worthy of death.  <span class="verse" id="V65">65&#xA0;</span>Some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to beat him with fists, and to tell him, &#x201C;Prophesy!&#x201D; The officers struck him with the palms of their hands. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V66">66&#xA0;</span>As Peter was in the courtyard below, one of the maids of the high priest came,  <span class="verse" id="V67">67&#xA0;</span>and seeing Peter warming himself, she looked at him and said, &#x201C;You were also with the Nazarene, Jesus!&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V68">68&#xA0;</span>But he denied it, saying, &#x201C;I neither know nor understand what you are saying.&#x201D; He went out on the porch, and the rooster crowed. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V69">69&#xA0;</span>The maid saw him and began again to tell those who stood by, &#x201C;This is one of them.&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V70">70&#xA0;</span>But he again denied it.
