I have lived as a foreigner with Laban, and stayed until now.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#xA0;</span>I have cattle, donkeys, flocks, male servants, and female servants. I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find favour in your sight.&#x2019;&#xA0;&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#xA0;</span>The messengers returned to Jacob, saying, &#x201C;We came to your brother Esau. He is coming to meet you, and four hundred men are with him.&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#xA0;</span>Then Jacob was greatly afraid and was distressed. He divided the people who were with him, along with the flocks, the herds, and the camels, into two companies.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#xA0;</span>He said, &#x201C;If Esau comes to the one company, and strikes it, then the company which is left will escape.&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#xA0;</span>Jacob said, &#x201C;God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, the LORD, who said to me, &#x2018;Return to your country, and to your relatives, and I will do you good,&#x2019;  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#xA0;</span>I am not worthy of the least of all the loving kindnesses, and of all the truth, which you have shown to your servant; for with just my staff I crossed over this Jordan; and now I have become two companies.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#xA0;</span>Please deliver me from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau; for I fear him, lest he come and strike me and the mothers with the children.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#xA0;</span>You said, &#x2018;I will surely do you good, and make your offspring as the sand of the sea, which can&#x2019;t be counted because there are so many.&#x2019;&#xA0;&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#xA0;</span>He stayed there that night, and took from that which he had with him a present for Esau, his brother:  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#xA0;</span>two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#xA0;</span>thirty milk camels and their colts, forty cows, ten bulls, twenty female donkeys and ten foals.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#xA0;</span>He delivered them into the hands of his servants, every herd by itself, and said to his servants, &#x201C;Pass over before me, and put a space between herd and herd.&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#xA0;</span>He commanded the foremost, saying, &#x201C;When Esau, my brother, meets you, and asks you, saying, &#x2018;Whose are you? Where are you going? Whose are these before you?&#x2019;  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#xA0;</span>Then you shall say, &#x2018;They are your servant, Jacob&#x2019;s. It is a present sent to my lord, Esau. Behold, he also is behind us.&#x2019;&#xA0;&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#xA0;</span>He commanded also the second, and the third, and all that followed the herds, saying, &#x201C;This is how you shall speak to Esau, when you find him.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#xA0;</span>You shall say, &#x2018;Not only that, but behold, your servant, Jacob, is behind us.&#x2019;&#xA0;&#x201D; For, he said, &#x201C;I will appease him with the present that goes before me, and afterward I will see his face. Perhaps he will accept me.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#xA0;</span>So the present passed over before him, and he himself stayed that night in the camp. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#xA0;</span>He rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two servants, and his eleven sons, and crossed over the ford of the Jabbok.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#xA0;</span>He took them, and sent them over the stream, and sent over that which he had.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#xA0;</span>Jacob was left alone, and wrestled with a man there until the breaking of the day.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#xA0;</span>When he saw that he didn&#x2019;t prevail against him, the man touched the hollow of his thigh, and the hollow of Jacob&#x2019;s thigh was strained as he wrestled.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#xA0;</span>The man said, &#x201C;Let me go, for the day breaks.&#x201D; </div><div class="p">Jacob said, &#x201C;I won&#x2019;t let you go unless you bless me.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#xA0;</span>He said to him, &#x201C;What is your name?&#x201D; </div><div class="p">He said, &#x201C;Jacob&#x201D;. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#xA0;</span>He said, &#x201C;Your name will no longer be called Jacob, but Israel; for you have fought with God and with men, and have prevailed.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#xA0;</span>Jacob asked him, &#x201C;Please tell me your name.&#x201D; </div><div class="p">He said, &#x201C;Why is it that you ask what my name is?&#x201D; So he blessed him there. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#xA0;</span>Jacob called the name of the place Peniel;<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">&#x2020;<span class="popup"> Peniel means &#x201C;face of God&#x201D;.</span></a> for he said, &#x201C;I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#xA0;</span>The sun rose on him as he passed over Peniel, and he limped because of his thigh.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#xA0;</span>Therefore the children of Israel don&#x2019;t eat the sinew of the hip, which is on the hollow of the thigh, to this day, because he touched the hollow of Jacob&#x2019;s thigh in the sinew of the hip. </div>
