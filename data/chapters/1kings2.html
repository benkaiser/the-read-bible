You be strong therefore, and show yourself a man;  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#xA0;</span>and keep the instruction of the LORD your God, to walk in his ways, to keep his statutes, his commandments, his ordinances, and his testimonies, according to that which is written in the law of Moses, that you may prosper in all that you do and wherever you turn yourself.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#xA0;</span>Then the LORD may establish his word which he spoke concerning me, saying, &#x2018;If your children are careful of their way, to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul, there shall not fail you,&#x2019; he said, &#x2018;a man on the throne of Israel.&#x2019; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#xA0;</span>&#x201C;Moreover you know also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me, even what he did to the two captains of the armies of Israel, to Abner the son of Ner and to Amasa the son of Jether, whom he killed, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war on his sash that was around his waist and in his sandals that were on his feet.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#xA0;</span>Do therefore according to your wisdom, and don&#x2019;t let his grey head go down to Sheol<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Sheol is the place of the dead.</span></a> in peace.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#xA0;</span>But show kindness to the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be amongst those who eat at your table; for so they came to me when I fled from Absalom your brother. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#xA0;</span>&#x201C;Behold, there is with you Shimei the son of Gera, the Benjamite of Bahurim, who cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I went to Mahanaim; but he came down to meet me at the Jordan, and I swore to him by the LORD, saying, &#x2018;I will not put you to death with the sword.&#x2019;  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#xA0;</span>Now therefore don&#x2019;t hold him guiltless, for you are a wise man; and you will know what you ought to do to him, and you shall bring his grey head down to Sheol<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">&#x2020;<span class="popup"> Sheol is the place of the dead.</span></a> with blood.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#xA0;</span>David slept with his fathers, and was buried in David&#x2019;s city.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#xA0;</span>The days that David reigned over Israel were forty years; he reigned seven years in Hebron, and he reigned thirty-three years in Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#xA0;</span>Solomon sat on David his father&#x2019;s throne; and his kingdom was firmly established. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#xA0;</span>Then Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon.

As my lord the king has said, so will your servant do.&#x201D; Shimei lived in Jerusalem many days. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#xA0;</span>At the end of three years, two of Shimei&#x2019;s slaves ran away to Achish, son of Maacah, king of Gath.

Therefore the LORD will return your wickedness on your own head.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#xA0;</span>But King Solomon will be blessed, and David&#x2019;s throne will be established before the LORD forever.&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#xA0;</span>So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he went out, and fell on him, so that he died. The kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon. </div>
