They took Dagon and set him in his place again.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#xA0;</span>When they arose early on the following morning, behold, Dagon had fallen on his face to the ground before the LORD&#x2019;s ark; and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands were cut off on the threshold. Only Dagon&#x2019;s torso was intact.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#xA0;</span>Therefore neither the priests of Dagon nor any who come into Dagon&#x2019;s house step on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod to this day.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#xA0;</span>But the LORD&#x2019;s hand was heavy on the people of Ashdod, and he destroyed them and struck them with tumours, even Ashdod and its borders. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#xA0;</span>When the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said, &#x201C;The ark of the God of Israel shall not stay with us, for his hand is severe on us and on Dagon our god.&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#xA0;</span>They sent therefore and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and said, &#x201C;What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel?&#x201D; </div><div class="p">They answered, &#x201C;Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried over to Gath.&#x201D; They carried the ark of the God of Israel there.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#xA0;</span>It was so, that after they had carried it there, the LORD&#x2019;s hand was against the city with a very great confusion; and he struck the men of the city, both small and great, so that tumours broke out on them.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#xA0;</span>So they sent God&#x2019;s ark to Ekron. </div><div class="p">As God&#x2019;s ark came to Ekron, the Ekronites cried out, saying, &#x201C;They have brought the ark of the God of Israel here to us, to kill us and our people.&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#xA0;</span>They sent therefore and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and they said, &#x201C;Send the ark of the God of Israel away, and let it go again to its own place, that it not kill us and our people.&#x201D; For there was a deadly panic throughout all the city.
