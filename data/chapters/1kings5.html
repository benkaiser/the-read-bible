There is no enemy and no evil occurrence.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#xA0;</span>Behold, I intend to build a house for the name of the LORD my God, as the LORD spoke to David my father, saying, &#x2018;Your son, whom I will set on your throne in your place shall build the house for my name.&#x2019;  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#xA0;</span>Now therefore command that cedar trees be cut for me out of Lebanon. My servants will be with your servants; and I will give you wages for your servants according to all that you say.
