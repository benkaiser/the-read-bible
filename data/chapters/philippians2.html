As a child serves a father, so he served with me in furtherance of the Good News.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#xA0;</span>Therefore I hope to send him at once, as soon as I see how it will go with me.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#xA0;</span>But I trust in the Lord that I myself also will come shortly. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#xA0;</span>But I thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, fellow worker, fellow soldier, and your apostle and servant of my need,  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#xA0;</span>since he longed for you all, and was very troubled because you had heard that he was sick.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#xA0;</span>For indeed he was sick nearly to death, but God had mercy on him, and not on him only, but on me also, that I might not have sorrow on sorrow.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#xA0;</span>I have sent him therefore the more diligently, that when you see him again, you may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#xA0;</span>Receive him therefore in the Lord with all joy, and hold such people in honour,  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#xA0;</span>because for the work of Christ he came near to death, risking his life to supply that which was lacking in your service towards me. </div>
