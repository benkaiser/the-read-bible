You shall serve him, and cling to him.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#xA0;</span>That prophet, or that dreamer of dreams, shall be put to death, because he has spoken rebellion against the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt and redeemed you out of the house of bondage, to draw you aside out of the way which the LORD your God commanded you to walk in. So you shall remove the evil from amongst you. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#xA0;</span>If your brother, the son of your mother, or your son, or your daughter, or the wife of your bosom, or your friend who is as your own soul, entices you secretly, saying, &#x201C;Let&#x2019;s go and serve other gods&#x201D;&#x2014;which you have not known, you, nor your fathers;  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#xA0;</span>of the gods of the peoples who are around you, near to you, or far off from you, from the one end of the earth even to the other end of the earth&#x2014;  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#xA0;</span>you shall not consent to him nor listen to him; neither shall your eye pity him, neither shall you spare, neither shall you conceal him;  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#xA0;</span>but you shall surely kill him.
