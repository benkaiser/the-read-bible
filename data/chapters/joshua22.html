Therefore now return and go to your tents, to the land of your possession, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave you beyond the Jordan.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#xA0;</span>Only take diligent heed to do the commandment and the law which Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, to love the LORD your God, to walk in all his ways, to keep his commandments, to hold fast to him, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#xA0;</span>So Joshua blessed them, and sent them away; and they went to their tents.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#xA0;</span>Now to the one half-tribe of Manasseh Moses had given inheritance in Bashan; but Joshua gave to the other half amongst their brothers beyond the Jordan westward. Moreover when Joshua sent them away to their tents, he blessed them,  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#xA0;</span>and spoke to them, saying, &#x201C;Return with much wealth to your tents, with very much livestock, with silver, with gold, with bronze, with iron, and with very much clothing.

It will be, since you rebel today against the LORD, that tomorrow he will be angry with the whole congregation of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#xA0;</span>However, if the land of your possession is unclean, then pass over to the land of the possession of the LORD, in which the LORD&#x2019;s tabernacle dwells, and take possession amongst us; but don&#x2019;t rebel against the LORD, nor rebel against us, in building an altar other than the LORD our God&#x2019;s altar.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#xA0;</span>Didn&#x2019;t Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the devoted thing, and wrath fell on all the congregation of Israel?
