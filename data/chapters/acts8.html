A great persecution arose against the assembly which was in Jerusalem in that day. They were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except for the apostles.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#xA0;</span>Devout men buried Stephen and lamented greatly over him.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#xA0;</span>But Saul ravaged the assembly, entering into every house and dragged both men and women off to prison.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#xA0;</span>Therefore those who were scattered abroad went around preaching the word.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#xA0;</span>Philip went down to the city of Samaria and proclaimed to them the Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#xA0;</span>The multitudes listened with one accord to the things that were spoken by Philip when they heard and saw the signs which he did.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#xA0;</span>For unclean spirits came out of many of those who had them. They came out, crying with a loud voice. Many who had been paralysed and lame were healed.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#xA0;</span>There was great joy in that city. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#xA0;</span>But there was a certain man, Simon by name, who used to practise sorcery in the city and amazed the people of Samaria, making himself out to be some great one,  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#xA0;</span>to whom they all listened, from the least to the greatest, saying, &#x201C;This man is that great power of God.&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#xA0;</span>They listened to him because for a long time he had amazed them with his sorceries.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#xA0;</span>But when they believed Philip preaching good news concerning God&#x2019;s Kingdom and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptised, both men and women.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#xA0;</span>Simon himself also believed. Being baptised, he continued with Philip. Seeing signs and great miracles occurring, he was amazed. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#xA0;</span>Now when the apostles who were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them,  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#xA0;</span>who, when they had come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Spirit;  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#xA0;</span>for as yet he had fallen on none of them. They had only been baptised in the name of Christ Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#xA0;</span>Then they laid their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#xA0;</span>Now when Simon saw that the Holy Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles&#x2019; hands, he offered them money,  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#xA0;</span>saying, &#x201C;Give me also this power, that whomever I lay my hands on may receive the Holy Spirit.&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#xA0;</span>But Peter said to him, &#x201C;May your silver perish with you, because you thought you could obtain the gift of God with money!  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#xA0;</span>You have neither part nor lot in this matter, for your heart isn&#x2019;t right before God.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#xA0;</span>Repent therefore of this, your wickedness, and ask God if perhaps the thought of your heart may be forgiven you.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#xA0;</span>For I see that you are in the poison of bitterness and in the bondage of iniquity.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#xA0;</span>Simon answered, &#x201C;Pray for me to the Lord, that none of the things which you have spoken happen to me.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#xA0;</span>They therefore, when they had testified and spoken the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the Good News to many villages of the Samaritans. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#xA0;</span>Then an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying, &#x201C;Arise, and go towards the south to the way that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza.
