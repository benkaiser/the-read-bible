This also is vanity and a striving after wind. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#xA0;</span>The fool folds his hands together and ruins himself.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#xA0;</span>Better is a handful, with quietness, than two handfuls with labour and chasing after wind. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#xA0;</span>Then I returned and saw vanity under the sun.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#xA0;</span>There is one who is alone, and he has neither son nor brother. There is no end to all of his labour, neither are his eyes satisfied with wealth. &#x201C;For whom then do I labour and deprive my soul of enjoyment?&#x201D; This also is vanity. Yes, it is a miserable business. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#xA0;</span>Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labour.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#xA0;</span>For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow; but woe to him who is alone when he falls, and doesn&#x2019;t have another to lift him up.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#xA0;</span>Again, if two lie together, then they have warmth; but how can one keep warm alone?  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#xA0;</span>If a man prevails against one who is alone, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#xA0;</span>Better is a poor and wise youth than an old and foolish king who doesn&#x2019;t know how to receive admonition any more.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#xA0;</span>For out of prison he came out to be king; yes, even in his kingdom he was born poor.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#xA0;</span>I saw all the living who walk under the sun, that they were with the youth, the other, who succeeded him.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#xA0;</span>There was no end of all the people, even of all them over whom he was&#x2014;yet those who come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity and a chasing after wind. </div>
