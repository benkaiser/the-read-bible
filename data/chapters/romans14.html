Don&#x2019;t let him who doesn&#x2019;t eat judge him who eats, for God has accepted him.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#xA0;</span>Who are you who judge another&#x2019;s servant? To his own lord he stands or falls.

Another esteems every day alike. Let each man be fully assured in his own mind.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#xA0;</span>He who observes the day, observes it to the Lord; and he who does not observe the day, to the Lord he does not observe it. He who eats, eats to the Lord, for he gives God thanks. He who doesn&#x2019;t eat, to the Lord he doesn&#x2019;t eat, and gives God thanks.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#xA0;</span>For none of us lives to himself, and none dies to himself.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#xA0;</span>For if we live, we live to the Lord. Or if we die, we die to the Lord. If therefore we live or die, we are the Lord&#x2019;s.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#xA0;</span>For to this end Christ died, rose, and lived again, that he might be Lord of both the dead and the living. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#xA0;</span>But you, why do you judge your brother?
