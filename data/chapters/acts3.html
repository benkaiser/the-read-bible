In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, get up and walk!&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#xA0;</span>He took him by the right hand and raised him up. Immediately his feet and his ankle bones received strength.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#xA0;</span>Leaping up, he stood and began to walk. He entered with them into the temple, walking, leaping, and praising God.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#xA0;</span>All the people saw him walking and praising God.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#xA0;</span>They recognised him, that it was he who used to sit begging for gifts for the needy at the Beautiful Gate of the temple. They were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#xA0;</span>As the lame man who was healed held on to Peter and John, all the people ran together to them in the porch that is called Solomon&#x2019;s, greatly wondering. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#xA0;</span>When Peter saw it, he responded to the people, &#x201C;You men of Israel, why do you marvel at this man? Why do you fasten your eyes on us, as though by our own power or godliness we had made him walk?  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#xA0;</span>The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified his Servant Jesus, whom you delivered up and denied in the presence of Pilate, when he had determined to release him.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#xA0;</span>But you denied the Holy and Righteous One and asked for a murderer to be granted to you,  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#xA0;</span>and killed the Prince of life, whom God raised from the dead, to which we are witnesses.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#xA0;</span>By faith in his name, his name has made this man strong, whom you see and know. Yes, the faith which is through him has given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#xA0;</span>&#x201C;Now, brothers,<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">&#x2020;<span class="popup"> The word for &#x201C;brothers&#x201D; here may be also correctly translated &#x201C;brothers and sisters&#x201D; or &#x201C;siblings.&#x201D;</span></a> I know that you did this in ignorance, as did also your rulers.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#xA0;</span>But the things which God announced by the mouth of all his prophets, that Christ should suffer, he thus fulfilled. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#xA0;</span>&#x201C;Repent therefore, and turn again, that your sins may be blotted out, so that there may come times of refreshing from the presence of the Lord,  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#xA0;</span>and that he may send Christ Jesus, who was ordained for you before,  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#xA0;</span>whom heaven must receive until the times of restoration of all things, which God spoke long ago by the mouth of his holy prophets.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#xA0;</span>For Moses indeed said to the fathers, &#x2018;The Lord God will raise up a prophet for you from amongst your brothers, like me.
