Isaac went to Abimelech king of the Philistines, to Gerar.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#xA0;</span>The LORD appeared to him, and said, &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t go down into Egypt. Live in the land I will tell you about.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#xA0;</span>Live in this land, and I will be with you, and will bless you. For I will give to you, and to your offspring, all these lands, and I will establish the oath which I swore to Abraham your father.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#xA0;</span>I will multiply your offspring as the stars of the sky, and will give all these lands to your offspring. In your offspring all the nations of the earth will be blessed,  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#xA0;</span>because Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my requirements, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#xA0;</span>Isaac lived in Gerar.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#xA0;</span>The men of the place asked him about his wife. He said, &#x201C;She is my sister,&#x201D; for he was afraid to say, &#x201C;My wife&#x201D;, lest, he thought, &#x201C;the men of the place might kill me for Rebekah, because she is beautiful to look at.&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#xA0;</span>When he had been there a long time, Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac was caressing Rebekah, his wife.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#xA0;</span>Abimelech called Isaac, and said, &#x201C;Behold, surely she is your wife. Why did you say, &#x2018;She is my sister?&#x2019;&#xA0;&#x201D; </div><div class="p">Isaac said to him, &#x201C;Because I said, &#x2018;Lest I die because of her.&#x2019;&#xA0;&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#xA0;</span>Abimelech said, &#x201C;What is this you have done to us?

The LORD blessed him.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#xA0;</span>The man grew great, and grew more and more until he became very great.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#xA0;</span>He had possessions of flocks, possessions of herds, and a great household. The Philistines envied him.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#xA0;</span>Now all the wells which his father&#x2019;s servants had dug in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped, and filled with earth.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#xA0;</span>Abimelech said to Isaac, &#x201C;Go away from us, for you are much mightier than we.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#xA0;</span>Isaac departed from there, encamped in the valley of Gerar, and lived there. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#xA0;</span>Isaac dug again the wells of water, which they had dug in the days of Abraham his father, for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham. He called their names after the names by which his father had called them.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#xA0;</span>Isaac&#x2019;s servants dug in the valley, and found there a well of flowing<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Or, living.
