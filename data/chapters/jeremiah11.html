They have gone after other gods to serve them. The house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken my covenant which I made with their fathers.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#xA0;</span>Therefore the LORD says, &#x2018;Behold, I will bring evil on them which they will not be able to escape; and they will cry to me, but I will not listen to them.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#xA0;</span>Then the cities of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem will go and cry to the gods to which they offer incense, but they will not save them at all in the time of their trouble.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#xA0;</span>For according to the number of your cities are your gods, Judah; and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem you have set up altars to the shameful thing, even altars to burn incense to Baal.&#x2019; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#xA0;</span>&#x201C;Therefore don&#x2019;t pray for this people.
