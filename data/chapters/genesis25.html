Abraham became the father of Isaac.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#xA0;</span>Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Paddan Aram, the sister of Laban the Syrian, to be his wife.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#xA0;</span>Isaac entreated the LORD for his wife, because she was barren. The LORD was entreated by him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#xA0;</span>The children struggled together within her.

They named him Esau.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#xA0;</span>After that, his brother came out, and his hand had hold on Esau&#x2019;s heel. He was named Jacob. Isaac was sixty years old when she bore them. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#xA0;</span>The boys grew. Esau was a skilful hunter, a man of the field. Jacob was a quiet man, living in tents.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#xA0;</span>Now Isaac loved Esau, because he ate his venison. Rebekah loved Jacob.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#xA0;</span>Jacob boiled stew.
