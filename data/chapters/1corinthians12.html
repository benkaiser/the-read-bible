If the whole were hearing, where would the smelling be?  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#xA0;</span>But now God has set the members, each one of them, in the body, just as he desired.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#xA0;</span>If they were all one member, where would the body be?  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#xA0;</span>But now they are many members, but one body.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#xA0;</span>The eye can&#x2019;t tell the hand, &#x201C;I have no need for you,&#x201D; or again the head to the feet, &#x201C;I have no need for you.&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#xA0;</span>No, much rather, those members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#xA0;</span>Those parts of the body which we think to be less honourable, on those we bestow more abundant honour; and our unpresentable parts have more abundant modesty,  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#xA0;</span>while our presentable parts have no such need. But God composed the body together, giving more abundant honour to the inferior part,  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#xA0;</span>that there should be no division in the body, but that the members should have the same care for one another.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#xA0;</span>When one member suffers, all the members suffer with it. When one member is honoured, all the members rejoice with it. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#xA0;</span>Now you are the body of Christ, and members individually.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#xA0;</span>God has set some in the assembly: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then miracle workers, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, and various kinds of languages.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#xA0;</span>Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Are all miracle workers?  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#xA0;</span>Do all have gifts of healings? Do all speak with various languages? Do all interpret?  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#xA0;</span>But earnestly desire the best gifts. Moreover, I show a most excellent way to you. </div>
