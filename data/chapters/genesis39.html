Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh&#x2019;s, the captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him from the hand of the Ishmaelites that had brought him down there.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#xA0;</span>The LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man. He was in the house of his master the Egyptian.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#xA0;</span>His master saw that the LORD was with him, and that the LORD made all that he did prosper in his hand.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#xA0;</span>Joseph found favour in his sight. He ministered to him, and Potiphar made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#xA0;</span>From the time that he made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, the LORD blessed the Egyptian&#x2019;s house for Joseph&#x2019;s sake. The LORD&#x2019;s blessing was on all that he had, in the house and in the field.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#xA0;</span>He left all that he had in Joseph&#x2019;s hand. He didn&#x2019;t concern himself with anything, except for the food which he ate. </div><div class="p">Joseph was well-built and handsome.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#xA0;</span>After these things, his master&#x2019;s wife set her eyes on Joseph; and she said, &#x201C;Lie with me.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#xA0;</span>But he refused, and said to his master&#x2019;s wife, &#x201C;Behold, my master doesn&#x2019;t know what is with me in the house, and he has put all that he has into my hand.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#xA0;</span>No one is greater in this house than I am, and he has not kept back anything from me but you, because you are his wife. How then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#xA0;</span>As she spoke to Joseph day by day, he didn&#x2019;t listen to her, to lie by her, or to be with her.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#xA0;</span>About this time, he went into the house to do his work, and there were none of the men of the house inside.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#xA0;</span>She caught him by his garment, saying, &#x201C;Lie with me!&#x201D; </div><div class="p">He left his garment in her hand, and ran outside.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#xA0;</span>When she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and had run outside,  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#xA0;</span>she called to the men of her house, and spoke to them, saying, &#x201C;Behold, he has brought a Hebrew in to us to mock us. He came in to me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#xA0;</span>When he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, he left his garment by me, and ran outside.&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#xA0;</span>She laid up his garment by her, until his master came home.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#xA0;</span>She spoke to him according to these words, saying, &#x201C;The Hebrew servant, whom you have brought to us, came in to me to mock me,  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#xA0;</span>and as I lifted up my voice and cried, he left his garment by me, and ran outside.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#xA0;</span>When his master heard the words of his wife, which she spoke to him, saying, &#x201C;This is what your servant did to me,&#x201D; his wrath was kindled.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#xA0;</span>Joseph&#x2019;s master took him, and put him into the prison, the place where the king&#x2019;s prisoners were bound, and he was there in custody.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#xA0;</span>But the LORD was with Joseph, and showed kindness to him, and gave him favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#xA0;</span>The keeper of the prison committed to Joseph&#x2019;s hand all the prisoners who were in the prison.
