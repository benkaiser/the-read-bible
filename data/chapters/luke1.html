Your wife, Elizabeth, will bear you a son, and you shall call his name John.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#xA0;</span>You will have joy and gladness, and many will rejoice at his birth.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#xA0;</span>For he will be great in the sight of the Lord, and he will drink no wine nor strong drink.

They perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple. He continued making signs to them, and remained mute.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#xA0;</span>When the days of his service were fulfilled, he departed to his house.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#xA0;</span>After these days Elizabeth his wife conceived, and she hid herself five months, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#xA0;</span>&#x201C;Thus has the Lord done to me in the days in which he looked at me, to take away my reproach amongst men.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#xA0;</span>Now in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth,  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#xA0;</span>to a virgin pledged to be married to a man whose name was Joseph, of David&#x2019;s house.
