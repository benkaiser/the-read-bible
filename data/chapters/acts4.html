Because indeed a notable miracle has been done through them, as can be plainly seen by all who dwell in Jerusalem, and we can&#x2019;t deny it.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#xA0;</span>But so that this spreads no further amongst the people, let&#x2019;s threaten them, that from now on they don&#x2019;t speak to anyone in this name.&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#xA0;</span>They called them, and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#xA0;</span>But Peter and John answered them, &#x201C;Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you rather than to God, judge for yourselves,  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#xA0;</span>for we can&#x2019;t help telling the things which we saw and heard.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#xA0;</span>When they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding no way to punish them, because of the people; for everyone glorified God for that which was done.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#xA0;</span>For the man on whom this miracle of healing was performed was more than forty years old. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#xA0;</span>Being let go, they came to their own company and reported all that the chief priests and the elders had said to them.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#xA0;</span>When they heard it, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord and said, &#x201C;O Lord, you are God, who made the heaven, the earth, the sea, and all that is in them;  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#xA0;</span>who by the mouth of your servant David, said, </div><div class="q">&#x2018;Why do the nations rage, </div><div class="q2">and the peoples plot a vain thing? </div><div class="q"> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#xA0;</span>The kings of the earth take a stand, </div><div class="q2">and the rulers plot together, </div><div class="q2">against the Lord, and against his Christ.&#x2019;<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Christ (Greek) and Messiah (Hebrew) both mean Anointed One.</span></a><a href="#FN3" class="notemark">&#x2721;<span class="popup"> Psalm 2:1-2</span></a> </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#xA0;</span>&#x201C;For truly,<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">&#x2020;<span class="popup"> nu adds &#x201C;in this city,&#x201D;</span></a> both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the people of Israel, were gathered together against your holy servant Jesus, whom you anointed,  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#xA0;</span>to do whatever your hand and your counsel foreordained to happen.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#xA0;</span>Now, Lord, look at their threats, and grant to your servants to speak your word with all boldness,  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#xA0;</span>while you stretch out your hand to heal; and that signs and wonders may be done through the name of your holy Servant Jesus.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#xA0;</span>When they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were gathered together.
