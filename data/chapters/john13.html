He took a towel and wrapped a towel around his waist.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#xA0;</span>Then he poured water into the basin, and began to wash the disciples&#x2019; feet and to wipe them with the towel that was wrapped around him.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#xA0;</span>Then he came to Simon Peter. He said to him, &#x201C;Lord, do you wash my feet?&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#xA0;</span>Jesus answered him, <span class="wj">&#x201C;You don&#x2019;t know what I am doing now, but you will understand later.&#x201D;</span> </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#xA0;</span>Peter said to him, &#x201C;You will never wash my feet!&#x201D; </div><div class="p">Jesus answered him, <span class="wj">&#x201C;If I don&#x2019;t wash you, you have no part with me.&#x201D; </span> </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#xA0;</span>Simon Peter said to him, &#x201C;Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head!&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#xA0;</span>Jesus said to him, <span class="wj">&#x201C;Someone who has bathed only needs to have his feet washed, but is completely clean. You are clean, but not all of you.&#x201D; </span>  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#xA0;</span>For he knew him who would betray him; therefore he said, <span class="wj">&#x201C;You are not all clean.&#x201D;</span>  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#xA0;</span>So when he had washed their feet, put his outer garment back on, and sat down again, he said to them, <span class="wj">&#x201C;Do you know what I have done to you? </span>  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#xA0;</span> <span class="wj">You call me, &#x2018;Teacher&#x2019; and &#x2018;Lord.&#x2019; You say so correctly, for so I am. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#xA0;</span> <span class="wj">If I then, the Lord and the Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another&#x2019;s feet. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#xA0;</span> <span class="wj">For I have given you an example, that you should also do as I have done to you. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#xA0;</span> <span class="wj">Most certainly I tell you, a servant is not greater than his lord, neither is one who is sent greater than he who sent him. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#xA0;</span> <span class="wj">If you know these things, blessed are you if you do them. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#xA0;</span> <span class="wj">I don&#x2019;t speak concerning all of you.
