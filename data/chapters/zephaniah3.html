She didn&#x2019;t receive correction. She didn&#x2019;t trust in the LORD. She didn&#x2019;t draw near to her God. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#xA0;</span>Her princes within her are roaring lions. Her judges are evening wolves. They leave nothing until the next day.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#xA0;</span>Her prophets are arrogant and treacherous people. Her priests have profaned the sanctuary. They have done violence to the law.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#xA0;</span>The LORD, within her, is righteous. He will do no wrong. Every morning he brings his justice to light. He doesn&#x2019;t fail, but the unjust know no shame. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#xA0;</span>I have cut off nations. Their battlements are desolate. I have made their streets waste, so that no one passes by. Their cities are destroyed, so that there is no man, so that there is no inhabitant.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#xA0;</span>I said, &#x201C;Just fear me. Receive correction,&#x201D; so that her dwelling won&#x2019;t be cut off, according to all that I have appointed concerning her.

Shout, Israel! Be glad and rejoice with all your heart, daughter of Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#xA0;</span>The LORD has taken away your judgements. He has thrown out your enemy. The King of Israel, the LORD, is amongst you. You will not be afraid of evil any more.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#xA0;</span>In that day, it will be said to Jerusalem, &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t be afraid, Zion. Don&#x2019;t let your hands be weak.&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#xA0;</span>The LORD, your God, is amongst you, a mighty one who will save. He will rejoice over you with joy. He will calm you in his love. He will rejoice over you with singing.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#xA0;</span>I will remove those who grieve about the appointed feasts from you. They are a burden and a reproach to you.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#xA0;</span>Behold,<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> &#x201C;Behold&#x201D;, from &#x201C;&#x5D4;&#x5B4;&#x5E0;&#x5BC;&#x5B5;&#x5D4;&#x201D;, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at. It is often used as an interjection.</span></a> at that time I will deal with all those who afflict you; and I will save those who are lame and gather those who were driven away. I will give them praise and honour, whose shame has been in all the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#xA0;</span>At that time I will bring you in, and at that time I will gather you; for I will give you honour and praise amongst all the peoples of the earth when I restore your fortunes before your eyes, says the LORD. </div>
