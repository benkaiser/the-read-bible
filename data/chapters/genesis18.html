When he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself to the earth,  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#xA0;</span>and said, &#x201C;My lord, if now I have found favour in your sight, please don&#x2019;t go away from your servant.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#xA0;</span>Now let a little water be fetched, wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#xA0;</span>I will get a piece of bread so you can refresh your heart. After that you may go your way, now that you have come to your servant.&#x201D; </div><div class="p">They said, &#x201C;Very well, do as you have said.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#xA0;</span>Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah, and said, &#x201C;Quickly prepare three seahs<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> 1 seah is about 7 litres or 1.9 gallons or 0.8 pecks</span></a> of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes.&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#xA0;</span>Abraham ran to the herd, and fetched a tender and good calf, and gave it to the servant. He hurried to dress it.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#xA0;</span>He took butter, milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them. He stood by them under the tree, and they ate. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#xA0;</span>They asked him, &#x201C;Where is Sarah, your wife?&#x201D; </div><div class="p">He said, &#x201C;There, in the tent.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#xA0;</span>He said, &#x201C;I will certainly return to you at about this time next year; and behold, Sarah your wife will have a son.&#x201D; </div><div class="p">Sarah heard in the tent door, which was behind him.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#xA0;</span>Now Abraham and Sarah were old, well advanced in age. Sarah had passed the age of childbearing.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#xA0;</span>Sarah laughed within herself, saying, &#x201C;After I have grown old will I have pleasure, my lord being old also?&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#xA0;</span>The LORD said to Abraham, &#x201C;Why did Sarah laugh, saying, &#x2018;Will I really bear a child when I am old?&#x2019;  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#xA0;</span>Is anything too hard for the LORD? At the set time I will return to you, when the season comes around, and Sarah will have a son.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#xA0;</span>Then Sarah denied it, saying, &#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t laugh,&#x201D; for she was afraid. </div><div class="p">He said, &#x201C;No, but you did laugh.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#xA0;</span>The men rose up from there, and looked towards Sodom. Abraham went with them to see them on their way.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#xA0;</span>The LORD said, &#x201C;Will I hide from Abraham what I do,  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#xA0;</span>since Abraham will surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth will be blessed in him?  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#xA0;</span>For I have known him, to the end that he may command his children and his household after him, that they may keep the way of the LORD, to do righteousness and justice; to the end that the LORD may bring on Abraham that which he has spoken of him.&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#xA0;</span>The LORD said, &#x201C;Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous,  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#xA0;</span>I will go down now, and see whether their deeds are as bad as the reports which have come to me.
