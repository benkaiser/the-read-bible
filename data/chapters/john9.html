The night is coming, when no one can work. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#xA0;</span> <span class="wj">While I am in the world, I am the light of the world.&#x201D;</span>  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#xA0;</span>When he had said this, he spat on the ground, made mud with the saliva, anointed the blind man&#x2019;s eyes with the mud,  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#xA0;</span>and said to him, <span class="wj">&#x201C;Go, wash in the pool of Siloam&#x201D;</span> (which means &#x201C;Sent&#x201D;). So he went away, washed, and came back seeing. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#xA0;</span>Therefore the neighbours and those who saw that he was blind before said, &#x201C;Isn&#x2019;t this he who sat and begged?&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#xA0;</span>Others were saying, &#x201C;It is he.&#x201D; Still others were saying, &#x201C;He looks like him.&#x201D; </div><div class="p">He said, &#x201C;I am he.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#xA0;</span>They therefore were asking him, &#x201C;How were your eyes opened?&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#xA0;</span>He answered, &#x201C;A man called Jesus made mud, anointed my eyes, and said to me, <span class="wj">&#x2018;Go to the pool of Siloam and wash.&#x2019;</span> So I went away and washed, and I received sight.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#xA0;</span>Then they asked him, &#x201C;Where is he?&#x201D; </div><div class="p">He said, &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#xA0;</span>They brought him who had been blind to the Pharisees.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#xA0;</span>It was a Sabbath when Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#xA0;</span>Again therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he received his sight. He said to them, &#x201C;He put mud on my eyes, I washed, and I see.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#xA0;</span>Some therefore of the Pharisees said, &#x201C;This man is not from God, because he doesn&#x2019;t keep the Sabbath.&#x201D; </div><div class="p">Others said, &#x201C;How can a man who is a sinner do such signs?&#x201D; So there was division amongst them. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#xA0;</span>Therefore they asked the blind man again, &#x201C;What do you say about him, because he opened your eyes?&#x201D; </div><div class="p">He said, &#x201C;He is a prophet.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#xA0;</span>The Jews therefore didn&#x2019;t believe concerning him, that he had been blind and had received his sight, until they called the parents of him who had received his sight,  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#xA0;</span>and asked them, &#x201C;Is this your son, whom you say was born blind? How then does he now see?&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#xA0;</span>His parents answered them, &#x201C;We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind;  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#xA0;</span>but how he now sees, we don&#x2019;t know; or who opened his eyes, we don&#x2019;t know. He is of age. Ask him. He will speak for himself.&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#xA0;</span>His parents said these things because they feared the Jews; for the Jews had already agreed that if any man would confess him as Christ, he would be put out of the synagogue.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#xA0;</span>Therefore his parents said, &#x201C;He is of age. Ask him.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#xA0;</span>So they called the man who was blind a second time, and said to him, &#x201C;Give glory to God. We know that this man is a sinner.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#xA0;</span>He therefore answered, &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know if he is a sinner. One thing I do know: that though I was blind, now I see.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#xA0;</span>They said to him again, &#x201C;What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#xA0;</span>He answered them, &#x201C;I told you already, and you didn&#x2019;t listen. Why do you want to hear it again? You don&#x2019;t also want to become his disciples, do you?&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#xA0;</span>They insulted him and said, &#x201C;You are his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#xA0;</span>We know that God has spoken to Moses.
