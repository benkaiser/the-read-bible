Take a wife from there from the daughters of Laban, your mother&#x2019;s brother.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#xA0;</span>May God Almighty bless you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, that you may be a company of peoples,  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#xA0;</span>and give you the blessing of Abraham, to you and to your offspring with you, that you may inherit the land where you travel, which God gave to Abraham.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#xA0;</span>Isaac sent Jacob away. He went to Paddan Aram to Laban, son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob&#x2019;s and Esau&#x2019;s mother. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#xA0;</span>Now Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him away to Paddan Aram, to take him a wife from there, and that as he blessed him he gave him a command, saying, &#x201C;You shall not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan;&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#xA0;</span>and that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone to Paddan Aram.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#xA0;</span>Esau saw that the daughters of Canaan didn&#x2019;t please Isaac, his father.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#xA0;</span>So Esau went to Ishmael, and took, in addition to the wives that he had, Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael, Abraham&#x2019;s son, the sister of Nebaioth, to be his wife. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#xA0;</span>Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went towards Haran.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#xA0;</span>He came to a certain place, and stayed there all night, because the sun had set. He took one of the stones of the place, and put it under his head, and lay down in that place to sleep.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#xA0;</span>He dreamt and saw a stairway set upon the earth, and its top reached to heaven. Behold, the angels of God were ascending and descending on it.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#xA0;</span>Behold, the LORD stood above it, and said, &#x201C;I am the LORD, the God of Abraham your father, and the God of Isaac. I will give the land you lie on to you and to your offspring.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#xA0;</span>Your offspring will be as the dust of the earth, and you will spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south. In you and in your offspring, all the families of the earth will be blessed.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#xA0;</span>Behold, I am with you, and will keep you, wherever you go, and will bring you again into this land.
