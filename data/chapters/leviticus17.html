He has shed blood. That man shall be cut off from amongst his people.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#xA0;</span>This is to the end that the children of Israel may bring their sacrifices, which they sacrifice in the open field, that they may bring them to the LORD, to the door of the Tent of Meeting, to the priest, and sacrifice them for sacrifices of peace offerings to the LORD.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#xA0;</span>The priest shall sprinkle the blood on the LORD&#x2019;s altar at the door of the Tent of Meeting, and burn the fat for a pleasant aroma to the LORD.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#xA0;</span>They shall no more sacrifice their sacrifices to the goat idols, after which they play the prostitute.
