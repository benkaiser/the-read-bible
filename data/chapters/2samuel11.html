But David stayed at Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#xA0;</span>At evening, David arose from his bed and walked on the roof of the king&#x2019;s house. From the roof, he saw a woman bathing, and the woman was very beautiful to look at.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#xA0;</span>David sent and enquired after the woman. One said, &#x201C;Isn&#x2019;t this Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, Uriah the Hittite&#x2019;s wife?&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#xA0;</span>David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in to him, and he lay with her (for she was purified from her uncleanness); and she returned to her house.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#xA0;</span>The woman conceived; and she sent and told David, and said, &#x201C;I am with child.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#xA0;</span>David sent to Joab, &#x201C;Send me Uriah the Hittite.&#x201D; Joab sent Uriah to David.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#xA0;</span>When Uriah had come to him, David asked him how Joab did, and how the people fared, and how the war prospered.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#xA0;</span>David said to Uriah, &#x201C;Go down to your house and wash your feet.&#x201D; Uriah departed out of the king&#x2019;s house, and a gift from the king was sent after him.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#xA0;</span>But Uriah slept at the door of the king&#x2019;s house with all the servants of his lord, and didn&#x2019;t go down to his house.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#xA0;</span>When they had told David, saying, &#x201C;Uriah didn&#x2019;t go down to his house,&#x201D; David said to Uriah, &#x201C;Haven&#x2019;t you come from a journey? Why didn&#x2019;t you go down to your house?&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#xA0;</span>Uriah said to David, &#x201C;The ark, Israel, and Judah, are staying in tents; and my lord Joab and the servants of my lord are encamped in the open field. Shall I then go into my house to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? As you live, and as your soul lives, I will not do this thing!&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#xA0;</span>David said to Uriah, &#x201C;Stay here today also, and tomorrow I will let you depart.&#x201D; So Uriah stayed in Jerusalem that day and the next day.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#xA0;</span>When David had called him, he ate and drank before him; and he made him drunk. At evening, he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord, but didn&#x2019;t go down to his house.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#xA0;</span>In the morning, David wrote a letter to Joab and sent it by the hand of Uriah.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#xA0;</span>He wrote in the letter, saying, &#x201C;Send Uriah to the forefront of the hottest battle, and retreat from him, that he may be struck and die.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#xA0;</span>When Joab kept watch on the city, he assigned Uriah to the place where he knew that valiant men were.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#xA0;</span>The men of the city went out and fought with Joab. Some of the people fell, even of David&#x2019;s servants; and Uriah the Hittite died also.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#xA0;</span>Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war;  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#xA0;</span>and he commanded the messenger, saying, &#x201C;When you have finished telling all the things concerning the war to the king,  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#xA0;</span>it shall be that, if the king&#x2019;s wrath arise, and he asks you, &#x2018;Why did you go so near to the city to fight? Didn&#x2019;t you know that they would shoot from the wall?  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#xA0;</span>Who struck Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? Didn&#x2019;t a woman cast an upper millstone on him from the wall, so that he died at Thebez? Why did you go so near the wall?&#x2019; then you shall say, &#x2018;Your servant Uriah the Hittite is also dead.&#x2019;&#xA0;&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#xA0;</span>So the messenger went, and came and showed David all that Joab had sent him for.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#xA0;</span>The messenger said to David, &#x201C;The men prevailed against us, and came out to us into the field; and we were on them even to the entrance of the gate.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#xA0;</span>The shooters shot at your servants from off the wall; and some of the king&#x2019;s servants are dead, and your servant Uriah the Hittite is also dead.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#xA0;</span>Then David said to the messenger, &#x201C;Tell Joab, &#x2018;Don&#x2019;t let this thing displease you, for the sword devours one as well as another. Make your battle stronger against the city, and overthrow it.&#x2019; Encourage him.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#xA0;</span>When Uriah&#x2019;s wife heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she mourned for her husband.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#xA0;</span>When the mourning was past, David sent and took her home to his house, and she became his wife and bore him a son. But the thing that David had done displeased the LORD. </div>
