Martha served, but Lazarus was one of those who sat at the table with him.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#xA0;</span>Therefore Mary took a pound<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> a Roman pound of 12 ounces, or about 340 grams</span></a> of ointment of pure nard, very precious, and anointed Jesus&#x2019;s feet and wiped his feet with her hair.
