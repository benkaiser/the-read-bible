When they had taken him, they brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath; and he pronounced judgement on him.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#xA0;</span>Then the king of Babylon killed Zedekiah&#x2019;s sons in Riblah before his eyes. The king of Babylon also killed all the nobles of Judah.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#xA0;</span>Moreover he put out Zedekiah&#x2019;s eyes and bound him in fetters, to carry him to Babylon. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#xA0;</span>The Chaldeans burnt the king&#x2019;s house and the people&#x2019;s houses with fire and broke down the walls of Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#xA0;</span>Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive into Babylon the rest of the people who remained in the city, the deserters also who fell away to him, and the rest of the people who remained.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#xA0;</span>But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people, who had nothing, in the land of Judah, and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#xA0;</span>Now Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon commanded Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard concerning Jeremiah, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#xA0;</span>&#x201C;Take him and take care of him. Do him no harm; but do to him even as he tells you.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#xA0;</span>So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, Nebushazban, Rabsaris, and Nergal Sharezer, Rabmag, and all the chief officers of the king of Babylon  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#xA0;</span>sent and took Jeremiah out of the court of the guard, and committed him to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, that he should bring him home.
