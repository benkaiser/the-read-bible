You have fallen away from grace.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#xA0;</span>For we through the Spirit, by faith wait for the hope of righteousness.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#xA0;</span>For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision amounts to anything, but faith working through love. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#xA0;</span>You were running well! Who interfered with you that you should not obey the truth?  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#xA0;</span>This persuasion is not from him who calls you.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#xA0;</span>A little yeast grows through the whole lump.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#xA0;</span>I have confidence towards you in the Lord that you will think no other way. But he who troubles you will bear his judgement, whoever he is. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#xA0;</span>But I, brothers, if I still preach circumcision, why am I still persecuted? Then the stumbling block of the cross has been removed.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#xA0;</span>I wish that those who disturb you would cut themselves off. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#xA0;</span>For you, brothers, were called for freedom. Only don&#x2019;t use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh, but through love be servants to one another.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#xA0;</span>For the whole law is fulfilled in one word, in this: &#x201C;You shall love your neighbour as yourself.&#x201D;<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">&#x2721;<span class="popup"> Leviticus 19:18</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#xA0;</span>But if you bite and devour one another, be careful that you don&#x2019;t consume one another. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#xA0;</span>But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you won&#x2019;t fulfil the lust of the flesh.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#xA0;</span>For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; and these are contrary to one another, that you may not do the things that you desire.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#xA0;</span>But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#xA0;</span>Now the deeds of the flesh are obvious, which are: adultery, sexual immorality, uncleanness, lustfulness,  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#xA0;</span>idolatry, sorcery, hatred, strife, jealousies, outbursts of anger, rivalries, divisions, heresies,  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#xA0;</span>envy, murders, drunkenness, orgies, and things like these; of which I forewarn you, even as I also forewarned you, that those who practise such things will not inherit God&#x2019;s Kingdom. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#xA0;</span>But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faith,<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> or, faithfulness</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#xA0;</span>gentleness, and self-control.
