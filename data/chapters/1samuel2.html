There shall not be an old man in your house forever.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#xA0;</span>The man of yours whom I don&#x2019;t cut off from my altar will consume your eyes<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">&#xA7;<span class="popup"> or, blind your eyes with tears</span></a> and grieve your heart. All the increase of your house will die in the flower of their age.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#xA0;</span>This will be the sign to you that will come on your two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas: in one day they will both die.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#xA0;</span>I will raise up a faithful priest for myself who will do according to that which is in my heart and in my mind.
