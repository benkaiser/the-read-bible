However, I obtained mercy because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#xA0;</span>The grace of our Lord abounded exceedingly with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#xA0;</span>The saying is faithful and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am chief.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#xA0;</span>However, for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first, Jesus Christ might display all his patience for an example of those who were going to believe in him for eternal life.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#xA0;</span>Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, to God who alone is wise, be honour and glory forever and ever. Amen. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#xA0;</span>I commit this instruction to you, my child Timothy, according to the prophecies which were given to you before, that by them you may wage the good warfare,  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#xA0;</span>holding faith and a good conscience, which some having thrust away made a shipwreck concerning the faith,  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#xA0;</span>of whom are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I delivered to Satan that they might be taught not to blaspheme. </div>
