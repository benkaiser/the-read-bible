So the rich man will also fade away in his pursuits. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#xA0;</span>Blessed is a person who endures temptation, for when he has been approved, he will receive the crown of life which the Lord promised to those who love him. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#xA0;</span>Let no man say when he is tempted, &#x201C;I am tempted by God,&#x201D; for God can&#x2019;t be tempted by evil, and he himself tempts no one.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#xA0;</span>But each one is tempted when he is drawn away by his own lust and enticed.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#xA0;</span>Then the lust, when it has conceived, bears sin. The sin, when it is full grown, produces death.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#xA0;</span>Don&#x2019;t be deceived, my beloved brothers.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#xA0;</span>Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom can be no variation nor turning shadow.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#xA0;</span>Of his own will he gave birth to us by the word of truth, that we should be a kind of first fruits of his creatures. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#xA0;</span>So, then, my beloved brothers, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, and slow to anger;  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#xA0;</span>for the anger of man doesn&#x2019;t produce the righteousness of God.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#xA0;</span>Therefore, putting away all filthiness and overflowing of wickedness, receive with humility the implanted word, which is able to save your souls.<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">&#x2021;<span class="popup"> or, preserve your life.</span></a> </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#xA0;</span>But be doers of the word, and not only hearers, deluding your own selves.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#xA0;</span>For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man looking at his natural face in a mirror;  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#xA0;</span>for he sees himself, and goes away, and immediately forgets what kind of man he was.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#xA0;</span>But he who looks into the perfect law of freedom and continues, not being a hearer who forgets but a doer of the work, this man will be blessed in what he does. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#xA0;</span>If anyone amongst you thinks himself to be religious while he doesn&#x2019;t bridle his tongue, but deceives his heart, this man&#x2019;s religion is worthless.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#xA0;</span>Pure religion and undefiled before our God and Father is this: to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep oneself unstained by the world. </div>
