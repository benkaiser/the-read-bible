I have finished the course. I have kept the faith.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#xA0;</span>From now on, the crown of righteousness is stored up for me, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will give to me on that day; and not to me only, but also to all those who have loved his appearing. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#xA0;</span>Be diligent to come to me soon,  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#xA0;</span>for Demas left me, having loved this present world, and went to Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia; and Titus to Dalmatia.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#xA0;</span>Only Luke is with me. Take Mark and bring him with you, for he is useful to me for service.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#xA0;</span>But I sent Tychicus to Ephesus.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#xA0;</span>Bring the cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus when you come&#x2014;and the books, especially the parchments.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#xA0;</span>Alexander the coppersmith did much evil to me. The Lord will repay him according to his deeds.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#xA0;</span>Beware of him, for he greatly opposed our words. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#xA0;</span>At my first defence, no one came to help me, but all left me. May it not be held against them.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#xA0;</span>But the Lord stood by me and strengthened me, that through me the message might be fully proclaimed, and that all the Gentiles might hear. So I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#xA0;</span>And the Lord will deliver me from every evil work and will preserve me for his heavenly Kingdom. To him be the glory forever and ever. Amen. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#xA0;</span>Greet Prisca and Aquila, and the house of Onesiphorus.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#xA0;</span>Erastus remained at Corinth, but I left Trophimus at Miletus sick.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#xA0;</span>Be diligent to come before winter. Eubulus salutes you, as do Pudens, Linus, Claudia, and all the brothers. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#xA0;</span>The Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Grace be with you. Amen. </div>
