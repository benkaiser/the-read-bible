Blow the trumpet in Tekoa and raise up a signal on Beth Haccherem, for evil looks out from the north with a great destruction.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#xA0;</span>I will cut off the beautiful and delicate one, the daughter of Zion.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#xA0;</span>Shepherds with their flocks will come to her. They will pitch their tents against her all around. They will feed everyone in his place.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#xA0;</span>&#x201C;Prepare war against her! Arise! Let&#x2019;s go up at noon. Woe to us! For the day declines, for the shadows of the evening are stretched out.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#xA0;</span>Arise! Let&#x2019;s go up by night, and let&#x2019;s destroy her palaces.&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#xA0;</span>For the LORD of Armies said, &#x201C;Cut down trees, and cast up a mound against Jerusalem. This is the city to be visited. She is filled with oppression within herself.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#xA0;</span>As a well produces its waters, so she produces her wickedness. Violence and destruction is heard in her. Sickness and wounds are continually before me.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#xA0;</span>Be instructed, Jerusalem, lest my soul be alienated from you, lest I make you a desolation, an uninhabited land.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#xA0;</span>The LORD of Armies says, &#x201C;They will thoroughly glean the remnant of Israel like a vine. Turn again your hand as a grape gatherer into the baskets.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#xA0;</span>To whom should I speak and testify, that they may hear? Behold, their ear is uncircumcised, and they can&#x2019;t listen. Behold, the LORD&#x2019;s word has become a reproach to them. They have no delight in it.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#xA0;</span>Therefore I am full of the LORD&#x2019;s wrath. I am weary with holding it in. </div><div class="q">&#x201C;Pour it out on the children in the street, </div><div class="q2">and on the assembly of young men together; </div><div class="q">for even the husband with the wife will be taken, </div><div class="q2">the aged with him who is full of days. </div><div class="q"> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#xA0;</span>Their houses will be turned to others, </div><div class="q2">their fields and their wives together; </div><div class="q">for I will stretch out my hand on the inhabitants of the land, says the LORD.&#x201D; </div><div class="q"> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#xA0;</span>&#x201C;For from their least even to their greatest, everyone is given to covetousness. </div><div class="q2">From the prophet even to the priest, everyone deals falsely. </div><div class="q"> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#xA0;</span>They have healed also the hurt of my people superficially, </div><div class="q2">saying, &#x2018;Peace, peace!&#x2019; when there is no peace. </div><div class="q"> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#xA0;</span>Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? </div><div class="q2">No, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush. </div><div class="q">Therefore they will fall amongst those who fall. </div><div class="q2">When I visit them, they will be cast down,&#x201D; says the LORD. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#xA0;</span>The LORD says, &#x201C;Stand in the ways and see, and ask for the old paths, &#x2018;Where is the good way?&#x2019; and walk in it, and you will find rest for your souls. But they said, &#x2018;We will not walk in it.&#x2019;  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#xA0;</span>I set watchmen over you, saying, &#x2018;Listen to the sound of the trumpet!&#x2019; But they said, &#x2018;We will not listen!&#x2019;  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#xA0;</span>Therefore hear, you nations, and know, congregation, what is amongst them.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#xA0;</span>Hear, earth! Behold, I will bring evil on this people, even the fruit of their thoughts, because they have not listened to my words; and as for my law, they have rejected it.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#xA0;</span>To what purpose does frankincense from Sheba come to me, and the sweet cane from a far country? Your burnt offerings are not acceptable, and your sacrifices are not pleasing to me.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#xA0;</span>Therefore The LORD says, &#x201C;Behold, I will lay stumbling blocks before this people. The fathers and the sons together will stumble against them. The neighbour and his friend will perish.&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#xA0;</span>The LORD says, &#x201C;Behold, a people comes from the north country. A great nation will be stirred up from the uttermost parts of the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#xA0;</span>They take hold of bow and spear. They are cruel, and have no mercy. Their voice roars like the sea, and they ride on horses, everyone set in array, as a man to the battle, against you, daughter of Zion.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#xA0;</span>We have heard its report. Our hands become feeble. Anguish has taken hold of us, and pains as of a woman in labour.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#xA0;</span>Don&#x2019;t go out into the field or walk by the way; for the sword of the enemy and terror are on every side.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#xA0;</span>Daughter of my people, clothe yourself with sackcloth, and wallow in ashes! Mourn, as for an only son, most bitter lamentation, for the destroyer will suddenly come on us. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#xA0;</span>&#x201C;I have made you a tester of metals and a fortress amongst my people, that you may know and try their way.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#xA0;</span>They are all grievous rebels, going around to slander. They are bronze and iron. All of them deal corruptly.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#xA0;</span>The bellows blow fiercely. The lead is consumed in the fire. In vain they go on refining, for the wicked are not plucked away.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#xA0;</span>Men will call them rejected silver, because the LORD has rejected them.&#x201D; </div>
