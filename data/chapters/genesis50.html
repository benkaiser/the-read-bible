The Egyptians wept for Israel for seventy days. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#xA0;</span>When the days of weeping for him were past, Joseph spoke to Pharaoh&#x2019;s staff, saying, &#x201C;If now I have found favour in your eyes, please speak in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#xA0;</span>&#x2018;My father made me swear, saying, &#x201C;Behold, I am dying. Bury me in my grave which I have dug for myself in the land of Canaan.&#x201D; Now therefore, please let me go up and bury my father, and I will come again.&#x2019;&#xA0;&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#xA0;</span>Pharaoh said, &#x201C;Go up, and bury your father, just like he made you swear.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#xA0;</span>Joseph went up to bury his father; and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, all the elders of the land of Egypt,  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#xA0;</span>all the house of Joseph, his brothers, and his father&#x2019;s house. Only their little ones, their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#xA0;</span>Both chariots and horsemen went up with him. It was a very great company.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#xA0;</span>They came to the threshing floor of Atad, which is beyond the Jordan, and there they lamented with a very great and severe lamentation. He mourned for his father seven days.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#xA0;</span>When the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, &#x201C;This is a grievous mourning by the Egyptians.&#x201D; Therefore its name was called Abel Mizraim, which is beyond the Jordan.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#xA0;</span>His sons did to him just as he commanded them,  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#xA0;</span>for his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field, as a possession for a burial site, from Ephron the Hittite, near Mamre.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#xA0;</span>Joseph returned into Egypt&#x2014;he, and his brothers, and all that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#xA0;</span>When Joseph&#x2019;s brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, &#x201C;It may be that Joseph will hate us, and will fully pay us back for all the evil which we did to him.&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#xA0;</span>They sent a message to Joseph, saying, &#x201C;Your father commanded before he died, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#xA0;</span>&#x2018;You shall tell Joseph, &#x201C;Now please forgive the disobedience of your brothers, and their sin, because they did evil to you.&#x201D;&#xA0;&#x2019; Now, please forgive the disobedience of the servants of the God of your father.&#x201D; Joseph wept when they spoke to him.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#xA0;</span>His brothers also went and fell down before his face; and they said, &#x201C;Behold, we are your servants.&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#xA0;</span>Joseph said to them, &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t be afraid, for am I in the place of God?  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#xA0;</span>As for you, you meant evil against me, but God meant it for good, to save many people alive, as is happening today.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#xA0;</span>Now therefore don&#x2019;t be afraid. I will provide for you and your little ones.&#x201D; He comforted them, and spoke kindly to them. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#xA0;</span>Joseph lived in Egypt, he, and his father&#x2019;s house.
