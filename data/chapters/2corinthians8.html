Your abundance at this present time supplies their lack, that their abundance also may become a supply for your lack, that there may be equality.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#xA0;</span>As it is written, &#x201C;He who gathered much had nothing left over, and he who gathered little had no lack.&#x201D;<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">&#x2721;<span class="popup"> Exodus 16:18</span></a> </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#xA0;</span>But thanks be to God, who puts the same earnest care for you into the heart of Titus.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#xA0;</span>For he indeed accepted our exhortation, but being himself very earnest, he went out to you of his own accord.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#xA0;</span>We have sent together with him the brother whose praise in the Good News is known throughout all the assemblies.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#xA0;</span>Not only so, but he was also appointed by the assemblies to travel with us in this grace, which is served by us to the glory of the Lord himself, and to show our readiness.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#xA0;</span>We are avoiding this, that any man should blame us concerning this abundance which is administered by us.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#xA0;</span>Having regard for honourable things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#xA0;</span>We have sent with them our brother whom we have many times proved earnest in many things, but now much more earnest, by reason of the great confidence which he has in you.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#xA0;</span>As for Titus, he is my partner and fellow worker for you. As for our brothers, they are the apostles of the assemblies, the glory of Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#xA0;</span>Therefore show the proof of your love to them before the assemblies, and of our boasting on your behalf. </div>
