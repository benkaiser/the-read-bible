Add year to year; let the feasts come around;  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#xA0;</span>then I will distress Ariel, and there will be mourning and lamentation. She shall be to me as an altar hearth.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> or, Ariel</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#xA0;</span>I will encamp against you all around you, and will lay siege against you with posted troops. I will raise siege works against you.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#xA0;</span>You will be brought down, and will speak out of the ground. Your speech will mumble out of the dust. Your voice will be as of one who has a familiar spirit, out of the ground, and your speech will whisper out of the dust. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#xA0;</span>But the multitude of your foes will be like fine dust, and the multitude of the ruthless ones like chaff that blows away. Yes, it will be in an instant, suddenly.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#xA0;</span>She will be visited by the LORD of Armies with thunder, with earthquake, with great noise, with whirlwind and storm, and with the flame of a devouring fire.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#xA0;</span>The multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel, even all who fight against her and her stronghold, and who distress her, will be like a dream, a vision of the night.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#xA0;</span>It will be like when a hungry man dreams, and behold, he eats; but he awakes, and his hunger isn&#x2019;t satisfied; or like when a thirsty man dreams, and behold, he drinks; but he awakes, and behold, he is faint, and he is still thirsty. The multitude of all the nations that fight against Mount Zion will be like that. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#xA0;</span>Pause and wonder! Blind yourselves and be blind!
