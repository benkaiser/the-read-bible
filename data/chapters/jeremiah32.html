The great, the mighty God, the LORD of Armies is your name:  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#xA0;</span>great in counsel, and mighty in work; whose eyes are open to all the ways of the children of men, to give everyone according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings;  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#xA0;</span>who performed signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, even to this day, both in Israel and amongst other men; and made yourself a name, as it is today;  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#xA0;</span>and brought your people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs, with wonders, with a strong hand, with an outstretched arm, and with great terror;  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#xA0;</span>and gave them this land, which you swore to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#xA0;</span>They came in and possessed it, but they didn&#x2019;t obey your voice and didn&#x2019;t walk in your law.
