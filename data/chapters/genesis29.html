For out of that well they watered the flocks. The stone on the well&#x2019;s mouth was large.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#xA0;</span>There all the flocks were gathered. They rolled the stone from the well&#x2019;s mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone back on the well&#x2019;s mouth in its place.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#xA0;</span>Jacob said to them, &#x201C;My relatives, where are you from?&#x201D; </div><div class="p">They said, &#x201C;We are from Haran.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#xA0;</span>He said to them, &#x201C;Do you know Laban, the son of Nahor?&#x201D; </div><div class="p">They said, &#x201C;We know him.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#xA0;</span>He said to them, &#x201C;Is it well with him?&#x201D; </div><div class="p">They said, &#x201C;It is well.

Water the sheep, and go and feed them.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#xA0;</span>They said, &#x201C;We can&#x2019;t, until all the flocks are gathered together, and they roll the stone from the well&#x2019;s mouth. Then we will water the sheep.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#xA0;</span>While he was yet speaking with them, Rachel came with her father&#x2019;s sheep, for she kept them.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#xA0;</span>When Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban, his mother&#x2019;s brother, and the sheep of Laban, his mother&#x2019;s brother, Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well&#x2019;s mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother&#x2019;s brother.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#xA0;</span>Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#xA0;</span>Jacob told Rachel that he was her father&#x2019;s relative, and that he was Rebekah&#x2019;s son. She ran and told her father. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#xA0;</span>When Laban heard the news of Jacob, his sister&#x2019;s son, he ran to meet Jacob, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house. Jacob told Laban all these things.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#xA0;</span>Laban said to him, &#x201C;Surely you are my bone and my flesh.&#x201D; Jacob stayed with him for a month.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#xA0;</span>Laban said to Jacob, &#x201C;Because you are my relative, should you therefore serve me for nothing? Tell me, what will your wages be?&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#xA0;</span>Laban had two daughters. The name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#xA0;</span>Leah&#x2019;s eyes were weak, but Rachel was beautiful in form and attractive.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#xA0;</span>Jacob loved Rachel.

He said to Laban, &#x201C;What is this you have done to me? Didn&#x2019;t I serve with you for Rachel? Why then have you deceived me?&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#xA0;</span>Laban said, &#x201C;It is not done so in our place, to give the younger before the firstborn.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#xA0;</span>Fulfil the week of this one, and we will give you the other also for the service which you will serve with me for seven more years.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#xA0;</span>Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week.
