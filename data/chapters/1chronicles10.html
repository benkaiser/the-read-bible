Therefore Saul took his sword and fell on it.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#xA0;</span>When his armour bearer saw that Saul was dead, he likewise fell on his sword and died.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#xA0;</span>So Saul died with his three sons; and all his house died together.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#xA0;</span>When all the men of Israel who were in the valley saw that they fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they abandoned their cities, and fled; and the Philistines came and lived in them. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#xA0;</span>On the next day, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, they found Saul and his sons fallen on Mount Gilboa.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#xA0;</span>They stripped him and took his head and his armour, then sent into the land of the Philistines all around to carry the news to their idols and to the people.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#xA0;</span>They put his armour in the house of their gods, and fastened his head in the house of Dagon.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#xA0;</span>When all Jabesh Gilead heard all that the Philistines had done to Saul,  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#xA0;</span>all the valiant men arose and took away the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons, and brought them to Jabesh, and buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh, and fasted seven days. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#xA0;</span>So Saul died for his trespass which he committed against the LORD, because of the LORD&#x2019;s word, which he didn&#x2019;t keep, and also because he asked counsel of one who had a familiar spirit, to enquire,  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#xA0;</span>and didn&#x2019;t enquire of the LORD. Therefore he killed him, and turned the kingdom over to David the son of Jesse. </div>
