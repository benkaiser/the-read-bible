The key to the pit of the abyss was given to him.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#xA0;</span>He opened the pit of the abyss, and smoke went up out of the pit, like the smoke from a<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> TR adds &#x201C;great&#x201D;</span></a> burning furnace. The sun and the air were darkened because of the smoke from the pit.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#xA0;</span>Then out of the smoke came locusts on the earth, and power was given to them, as the scorpions of the earth have power.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#xA0;</span>They were told that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree, but only those people who don&#x2019;t have God&#x2019;s seal on their foreheads.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#xA0;</span>They were given power, not to kill them, but to torment them for five months. Their torment was like the torment of a scorpion when it strikes a person.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#xA0;</span>In those days people will seek death, and will in no way find it.

The sound of their wings was like the sound of many chariots and horses rushing to war.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#xA0;</span>They have tails like those of scorpions, with stingers. In their tails they have power to harm men for five months.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#xA0;</span>They have over them as king the angel of the abyss.
