Fill your horn with oil, and go. I will send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite, for I have provided a king for myself amongst his sons.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#xA0;</span>Samuel said, &#x201C;How can I go? If Saul hears it, he will kill me.&#x201D; </div><div class="p">The LORD said, &#x201C;Take a heifer with you, and say, &#x2018;I have come to sacrifice to the LORD.&#x2019;  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#xA0;</span>Call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what you shall do. You shall anoint to me him whom I name to you.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#xA0;</span>Samuel did that which the LORD spoke, and came to Bethlehem. The elders of the city came to meet him trembling, and said, &#x201C;Do you come peaceably?&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#xA0;</span>He said, &#x201C;Peaceably; I have come to sacrifice to the LORD. Sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice.&#x201D; He sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#xA0;</span>When they had come, he looked at Eliab, and said, &#x201C;Surely the LORD&#x2019;s anointed is before him.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#xA0;</span>But the LORD said to Samuel, &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t look on his face, or on the height of his stature, because I have rejected him; for I don&#x2019;t see as man sees. For man looks at the outward appearance, but the LORD looks at the heart.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#xA0;</span>Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. He said, &#x201C;The LORD has not chosen this one, either.&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#xA0;</span>Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. He said, &#x201C;The LORD has not chosen this one, either.&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#xA0;</span>Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. Samuel said to Jesse, &#x201C;The LORD has not chosen these.&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#xA0;</span>Samuel said to Jesse, &#x201C;Are all your children here?&#x201D; </div><div class="p">He said, &#x201C;There remains yet the youngest. Behold, he is keeping the sheep.&#x201D; </div><div class="p">Samuel said to Jesse, &#x201C;Send and get him, for we will not sit down until he comes here.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#xA0;</span>He sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, with a handsome face and good appearance. The LORD said, &#x201C;Arise! Anoint him, for this is he.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#xA0;</span>Then Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the middle of his brothers. Then the LORD&#x2019;s Spirit came mightily on David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up and went to Ramah.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#xA0;</span>Now the LORD&#x2019;s Spirit departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the LORD troubled him.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#xA0;</span>Saul&#x2019;s servants said to him, &#x201C;See now, an evil spirit from God troubles you.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#xA0;</span>Let our lord now command your servants who are in front of you to seek out a man who is a skilful player on the harp. Then when the evil spirit from God is on you, he will play with his hand, and you will be well.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#xA0;</span>Saul said to his servants, &#x201C;Provide me now a man who can play well, and bring him to me.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#xA0;</span>Then one of the young men answered and said, &#x201C;Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite who is skilful in playing, a mighty man of valour, a man of war, prudent in speech, and a handsome person; and the LORD is with him.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#xA0;</span>Therefore Saul sent messengers to Jesse, and said, &#x201C;Send me David your son, who is with the sheep.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#xA0;</span>Jesse took a donkey loaded with bread, a container of wine, and a young goat, and sent them by David his son to Saul.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#xA0;</span>David came to Saul and stood before him. He loved him greatly; and he became his armour bearer.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#xA0;</span>Saul sent to Jesse, saying, &#x201C;Please let David stand before me, for he has found favour in my sight.&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#xA0;</span>When the spirit from God was on Saul, David took the harp and played with his hand; so Saul was refreshed and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him. </div>
