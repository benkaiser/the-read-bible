For whatever things he does, these the Son also does likewise. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#xA0;</span> <span class="wj">For the Father has affection for the Son, and shows him all things that he himself does. He will show him greater works than these, that you may marvel. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#xA0;</span> <span class="wj">For as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son also gives life to whom he desires. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#xA0;</span> <span class="wj">For the Father judges no one, but he has given all judgement to the Son, </span>  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#xA0;</span> <span class="wj">that all may honour the Son, even as they honour the Father.
