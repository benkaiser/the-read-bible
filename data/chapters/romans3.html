Because first of all, they were entrusted with the revelations of God.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#xA0;</span>For what if some were without faith? Will their lack of faith nullify the faithfulness of God?  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#xA0;</span>May it never be! Yes, let God be found true, but every man a liar.

For there is no distinction,  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#xA0;</span>for all have sinned, and fall short of the glory of God;  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#xA0;</span>being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus,  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#xA0;</span>whom God sent to be an atoning sacrifice<a href="#FN8" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> or, a propitiation</span></a> through faith in his blood, for a demonstration of his righteousness through the passing over of prior sins, in God&#x2019;s forbearance;  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#xA0;</span>to demonstrate his righteousness at this present time, that he might himself be just and the justifier of him who has faith in Jesus. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#xA0;</span>Where then is the boasting?
