Saul had sent away those who had familiar spirits and the wizards out of the land. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#xA0;</span>The Philistines gathered themselves together, and came and encamped in Shunem; and Saul gathered all Israel together, and they encamped in Gilboa.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#xA0;</span>When Saul saw the army of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart trembled greatly.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#xA0;</span>When Saul enquired of the LORD, the LORD didn&#x2019;t answer him by dreams, by Urim, or by prophets.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#xA0;</span>Then Saul said to his servants, &#x201C;Seek for me a woman who has a familiar spirit, that I may go to her and enquire of her.&#x201D; </div><div class="p">His servants said to him, &#x201C;Behold, there is a woman who has a familiar spirit at Endor.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#xA0;</span>Saul disguised himself and put on other clothing, and went, he and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night.

Why then do you lay a snare for my life, to cause me to die?&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#xA0;</span>Saul swore to her by the LORD, saying, &#x201C;As the LORD lives, no punishment will happen to you for this thing.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#xA0;</span>Then the woman said, &#x201C;Whom shall I bring up to you?&#x201D; </div><div class="p">He said, &#x201C;Bring Samuel up for me.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#xA0;</span>When the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice; and the woman spoke to Saul, saying, &#x201C;Why have you deceived me? For you are Saul!&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#xA0;</span>The king said to her, &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t be afraid! What do you see?&#x201D; </div><div class="p">The woman said to Saul, &#x201C;I see a god coming up out of the earth.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#xA0;</span>He said to her, &#x201C;What does he look like?&#x201D; </div><div class="p">She said, &#x201C;An old man comes up. He is covered with a robe.&#x201D; Saul perceived that it was Samuel, and he bowed with his face to the ground, and showed respect. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#xA0;</span>Samuel said to Saul, &#x201C;Why have you disturbed me, to bring me up?&#x201D; </div><div class="p">Saul answered, &#x201C;I am very distressed; for the Philistines make war against me, and God has departed from me, and answers me no more, by prophets, or by dreams. Therefore I have called you, that you may make known to me what I shall do.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#xA0;</span>Samuel said, &#x201C;Why then do you ask me, since the LORD has departed from you and has become your adversary?  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#xA0;</span>The LORD has done to you as he spoke by me. The LORD has torn the kingdom out of your hand and given it to your neighbour, even to David.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#xA0;</span>Because you didn&#x2019;t obey the LORD&#x2019;s voice, and didn&#x2019;t execute his fierce wrath on Amalek, therefore the LORD has done this thing to you today.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#xA0;</span>Moreover the LORD will deliver Israel also with you into the hand of the Philistines; and tomorrow you and your sons will be with me. The LORD will deliver the army of Israel also into the hand of the Philistines.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#xA0;</span>Then Saul fell immediately his full length on the earth, and was terrified, because of Samuel&#x2019;s words. There was no strength in him, for he had eaten no bread all day long or all night long. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#xA0;</span>The woman came to Saul and saw that he was very troubled, and said to him, &#x201C;Behold, your servant has listened to your voice, and I have put my life in my hand, and have listened to your words which you spoke to me.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#xA0;</span>Now therefore, please listen also to the voice of your servant, and let me set a morsel of bread before you. Eat, that you may have strength when you go on your way.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#xA0;</span>But he refused, and said, &#x201C;I will not eat.&#x201D; But his servants, together with the woman, constrained him; and he listened to their voice. So he arose from the earth and sat on the bed.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#xA0;</span>The woman had a fattened calf in the house. She hurried and killed it; and she took flour and kneaded it, and baked unleavened bread of it.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#xA0;</span>She brought it before Saul and before his servants, and they ate. Then they rose up and went away that night. </div>
