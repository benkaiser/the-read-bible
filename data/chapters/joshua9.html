All the bread of their food supply was dry and mouldy.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#xA0;</span>They went to Joshua at the camp at Gilgal, and said to him and to the men of Israel, &#x201C;We have come from a far country. Now therefore make a covenant with us.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#xA0;</span>The men of Israel said to the Hivites, &#x201C;What if you live amongst us?

Tell them, &#x201C;We are your servants. Now make a covenant with us.&#x201D;&#xA0;&#x2019;  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#xA0;</span>This our bread we took hot for our supplies out of our houses on the day we went out to go to you; but now, behold, it is dry, and has become mouldy.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#xA0;</span>These wine skins, which we filled, were new; and behold, they are torn. These our garments and our sandals have become old because of the very long journey.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#xA0;</span>The men sampled their provisions, and didn&#x2019;t ask counsel from the LORD&#x2019;s mouth.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#xA0;</span>Joshua made peace with them, and made a covenant with them, to let them live. The princes of the congregation swore to them.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#xA0;</span>At the end of three days after they had made a covenant with them, they heard that they were their neighbours, and that they lived amongst them.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#xA0;</span>The children of Israel travelled and came to their cities on the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon, Chephirah, Beeroth, and Kiriath Jearim.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#xA0;</span>The children of Israel didn&#x2019;t strike them, because the princes of the congregation had sworn to them by the LORD, the God of Israel. All the congregation murmured against the princes.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#xA0;</span>But all the princes said to all the congregation, &#x201C;We have sworn to them by the LORD, the God of Israel. Now therefore we may not touch them.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#xA0;</span>We will do this to them, and let them live; lest wrath be on us, because of the oath which we swore to them.&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#xA0;</span>The princes said to them, &#x201C;Let them live.&#x201D; So they became wood cutters and drawers of water for all the congregation, as the princes had spoken to them. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#xA0;</span>Joshua called for them, and he spoke to them, saying, &#x201C;Why have you deceived us, saying, &#x2018;We are very far from you,&#x2019; when you live amongst us?  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#xA0;</span>Now therefore you are cursed, and some of you will never fail to be slaves, both wood cutters and drawers of water for the house of my God.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#xA0;</span>They answered Joshua, and said, &#x201C;Because your servants were certainly told how the LORD your God commanded his servant Moses to give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you. Therefore we were very afraid for our lives because of you, and have done this thing.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#xA0;</span>Now, behold, we are in your hand. Do to us as it seems good and right to you to do.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#xA0;</span>He did so to them, and delivered them out of the hand of the children of Israel, so that they didn&#x2019;t kill them.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#xA0;</span>That day Joshua made them wood cutters and drawers of water for the congregation and for the LORD&#x2019;s altar to this day, in the place which he should choose. </div>
