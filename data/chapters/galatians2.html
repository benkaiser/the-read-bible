But when they came, he drew back and separated himself, fearing those who were of the circumcision.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#xA0;</span>And the rest of the Jews joined him in his hypocrisy, so that even Barnabas was carried away with their hypocrisy.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#xA0;</span>But when I saw that they didn&#x2019;t walk uprightly according to the truth of the Good News, I said to Peter before them all, &#x201C;If you, being a Jew, live as the Gentiles do, and not as the Jews do, why do you compel the Gentiles to live as the Jews do? </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#xA0;</span>&#x201C;We, being Jews by nature and not Gentile sinners,  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#xA0;</span>yet knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ, even we believed in Christ Jesus, that we might be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of the law, because no flesh will be justified by the works of the law.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#xA0;</span>But if while we sought to be justified in Christ, we ourselves also were found sinners, is Christ a servant of sin? Certainly not!  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#xA0;</span>For if I build up again those things which I destroyed, I prove myself a law-breaker.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#xA0;</span>For I through the law died to the law, that I might live to God.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#xA0;</span>I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me. That life which I now live in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself up for me.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#xA0;</span>I don&#x2019;t reject the grace of God. For if righteousness is through the law, then Christ died for nothing!&#x201D; </div>
