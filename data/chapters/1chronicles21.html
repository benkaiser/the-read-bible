<div class="chapterlabel" id="V0"> 21</div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#xA0;</span>Satan stood up against Israel, and moved David to take a census of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#xA0;</span>David said to Joab and to the princes of the people, &#x201C;Go, count Israel from Beersheba even to Dan; and bring me word, that I may know how many there are.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#xA0;</span>Joab said, &#x201C;May the LORD make his people a hundred times as many as they are. But, my lord the king, aren&#x2019;t they all my lord&#x2019;s servants? Why does my lord require this thing? Why will he be a cause of guilt to Israel?&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#xA0;</span>Nevertheless the king&#x2019;s word prevailed against Joab. Therefore Joab departed and went throughout all Israel, then came to Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#xA0;</span>Joab gave the sum of the census of the people to David. All those of Israel were one million one hundred thousand men who drew a sword; and in Judah were four hundred and seventy thousand men who drew a sword.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#xA0;</span>But he didn&#x2019;t count Levi and Benjamin amongst them, for the king&#x2019;s word was abominable to Joab. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#xA0;</span>God was displeased with this thing; therefore he struck Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#xA0;</span>David said to God, &#x201C;I have sinned greatly, in that I have done this thing. But now put away, I beg you, the iniquity of your servant, for I have done very foolishly.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#xA0;</span>The LORD spoke to Gad, David&#x2019;s seer, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#xA0;</span>&#x201C;Go and speak to David, saying, &#x2018;The LORD says, &#x201C;I offer you three things. Choose one of them, that I may do it to you.&#x201D;&#xA0;&#x2019;&#xA0;&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#xA0;</span>So Gad came to David and said to him, &#x201C;The LORD says, &#x2018;Take your choice:  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#xA0;</span>either three years of famine; or three months to be consumed before your foes, while the sword of your enemies overtakes you; or else three days of the sword of the LORD, even pestilence in the land, and the LORD&#x2019;s angel destroying throughout all the borders of Israel. Now therefore consider what answer I shall return to him who sent me.&#x2019;&#xA0;&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#xA0;</span>David said to Gad, &#x201C;I am in distress. Let me fall, I pray, into the LORD&#x2019;s hand, for his mercies are very great. Don&#x2019;t let me fall into man&#x2019;s hand.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#xA0;</span>So the LORD sent a pestilence on Israel, and seventy thousand men of Israel fell.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#xA0;</span>God sent an angel to Jerusalem to destroy it. As he was about to destroy, the LORD saw, and he relented of the disaster, and said to the destroying angel, &#x201C;It is enough. Now withdraw your hand.&#x201D; the LORD&#x2019;s angel was standing by the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#xA0;</span>David lifted up his eyes, and saw the LORD&#x2019;s angel standing between earth and the sky, having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. </div><div class="p">Then David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell on their faces.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#xA0;</span>David said to God, &#x201C;Isn&#x2019;t it I who commanded the people to be counted? It is even I who have sinned and done very wickedly; but these sheep, what have they done? Please let your hand, O LORD my God, be against me and against my father&#x2019;s house; but not against your people, that they should be plagued.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#xA0;</span>Then the LORD&#x2019;s angel commanded Gad to tell David that David should go up and raise an altar to the LORD on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#xA0;</span>David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spoke in the LORD&#x2019;s name. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#xA0;</span>Ornan turned back and saw the angel; and his four sons who were with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#xA0;</span>As David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went out of the threshing floor, and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#xA0;</span>Then David said to Ornan, &#x201C;Sell me the place of this threshing floor, that I may build an altar to the LORD on it. You shall sell it to me for the full price, that the plague may be stopped from afflicting the people.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#xA0;</span>Ornan said to David, &#x201C;Take it for yourself, and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes. Behold, I give the oxen for burnt offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meal offering. I give it all.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#xA0;</span>King David said to Ornan, &#x201C;No, but I will most certainly buy it for the full price. For I will not take that which is yours for the LORD, nor offer a burnt offering that costs me nothing.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#xA0;</span>So David gave to Ornan six hundred shekels<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> A shekel is about 10 grams or about 0.32 Troy ounces, so 600 shekels was about 6 kilograms or about 192 Troy ounces.</span></a> of gold by weight for the place.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#xA0;</span>David built an altar to the LORD there, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, and called on the LORD; and he answered him from the sky by fire on the altar of burnt offering. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#xA0;</span>Then The LORD commanded the angel, and he put his sword back into its sheath. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#xA0;</span>At that time, when David saw that the LORD had answered him in the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#xA0;</span>For the LORD&#x2019;s tabernacle, which Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of burnt offering, were at that time in the high place at Gibeon.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#xA0;</span>But David couldn&#x2019;t go before it to enquire of God, for he was afraid because of the sword of the LORD&#x2019;s angel. </div>
