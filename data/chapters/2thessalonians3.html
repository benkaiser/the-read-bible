For we didn&#x2019;t behave ourselves rebelliously amongst you,  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#xA0;</span>neither did we eat bread from anyone&#x2019;s hand without paying for it, but in labour and travail worked night and day, that we might not burden any of you.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#xA0;</span>This was not because we don&#x2019;t have the right, but to make ourselves an example to you, that you should imitate us.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#xA0;</span>For even when we were with you, we commanded you this: &#x201C;If anyone is not willing to work, don&#x2019;t let him eat.&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#xA0;</span>For we hear of some who walk amongst you in rebellion, who don&#x2019;t work at all, but are busybodies.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#xA0;</span>Now those who are that way, we command and exhort in the Lord Jesus Christ, that they work with quietness and eat their own bread. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#xA0;</span>But you, brothers, don&#x2019;t be weary in doing what is right.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#xA0;</span>If any man doesn&#x2019;t obey our word in this letter, note that man and have no company with him, to the end that he may be ashamed.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#xA0;</span>Don&#x2019;t count him as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#xA0;</span>Now may the Lord of peace himself give you peace at all times in all ways. The Lord be with you all. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#xA0;</span>I, Paul, write this greeting with my own hand, which is the sign in every letter.
