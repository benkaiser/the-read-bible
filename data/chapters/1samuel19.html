But Jonathan, Saul&#x2019;s son, greatly delighted in David.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#xA0;</span>Jonathan told David, saying, &#x201C;Saul my father seeks to kill you. Now therefore, please take care of yourself in the morning, live in a secret place, and hide yourself.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#xA0;</span>I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where you are, and I will talk with my father about you; and if I see anything, I will tell you.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#xA0;</span>Jonathan spoke good of David to Saul his father, and said to him, &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t let the king sin against his servant, against David; because he has not sinned against you, and because his works have been very good towards you;  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#xA0;</span>for he put his life in his hand and struck the Philistine, and the LORD worked a great victory for all Israel. You saw it and rejoiced. Why then will you sin against innocent blood, to kill David without a cause?&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#xA0;</span>Saul listened to the voice of Jonathan; and Saul swore, &#x201C;As the LORD lives, he shall not be put to death.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#xA0;</span>Jonathan called David, and Jonathan showed him all those things. Then Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence as before. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#xA0;</span>There was war again. David went out and fought with the Philistines, and killed them with a great slaughter; and they fled before him. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#xA0;</span>An evil spirit from the LORD was on Saul as he sat in his house with his spear in his hand; and David was playing music with his hand.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#xA0;</span>Saul sought to pin David to the wall with the spear, but he slipped away out of Saul&#x2019;s presence; and he stuck the spear into the wall. David fled and escaped that night.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#xA0;</span>Saul sent messengers to David&#x2019;s house to watch him and to kill him in the morning. Michal, David&#x2019;s wife, told him, saying, &#x201C;If you don&#x2019;t save your life tonight, tomorrow you will be killed.&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#xA0;</span>So Michal let David down through the window. He went away, fled, and escaped.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#xA0;</span>Michal took the teraphim<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> teraphim were household idols that may have been associated with inheritance rights to the household property.</span></a> and laid it in the bed, and put a pillow of goats&#x2019; hair at its head and covered it with clothes.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#xA0;</span>When Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, &#x201C;He is sick.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#xA0;</span>Saul sent the messengers to see David, saying, &#x201C;Bring him up to me in the bed, that I may kill him.&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#xA0;</span>When the messengers came in, behold, the teraphim was in the bed, with the pillow of goats&#x2019; hair at its head. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#xA0;</span>Saul said to Michal, &#x201C;Why have you deceived me like this and let my enemy go, so that he has escaped?&#x201D; </div><div class="p">Michal answered Saul, &#x201C;He said to me, &#x2018;Let me go! Why should I kill you?&#x2019;&#xA0;&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#xA0;</span>Now David fled and escaped, and came to Samuel at Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him. He and Samuel went and lived in Naioth.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#xA0;</span>Saul was told, saying, &#x201C;Behold, David is at Naioth in Ramah.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#xA0;</span>Saul sent messengers to seize David; and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as head over them, God&#x2019;s Spirit came on Saul&#x2019;s messengers, and they also prophesied.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#xA0;</span>When Saul was told, he sent other messengers, and they also prophesied. Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they also prophesied.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#xA0;</span>Then he also went to Ramah, and came to the great well that is in Secu: and he asked, &#x201C;Where are Samuel and David?&#x201D; </div><div class="p">One said, &#x201C;Behold, they are at Naioth in Ramah.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#xA0;</span>He went there to Naioth in Ramah. Then God&#x2019;s Spirit came on him also, and he went on, and prophesied, until he came to Naioth in Ramah.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#xA0;</span>He also stripped off his clothes. He also prophesied before Samuel and lay down naked all that day and all that night. Therefore they say, &#x201C;Is Saul also amongst the prophets?&#x201D; </div>
