So all the people departed, each to his own house. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#xA0;</span>Then David returned to bless his household. Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, &#x201C;How glorious the king of Israel was today, who uncovered himself today in the eyes of his servants&#x2019; maids, as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovers himself!&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#xA0;</span>David said to Michal, &#x201C;It was before the LORD, who chose me above your father, and above all his house, to appoint me prince over the people of the LORD, over Israel. Therefore I will celebrate before the LORD.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#xA0;</span>I will be yet more undignified than this, and will be worthless in my own sight. But the maids of whom you have spoken will honour me.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#xA0;</span>Michal the daughter of Saul had no child to the day of her death. </div>
