When you overtake them, ask them, &#x2018;Why have you rewarded evil for good?  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#xA0;</span>Isn&#x2019;t this that from which my lord drinks, and by which he indeed divines? You have done evil in so doing.&#x2019;&#xA0;&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#xA0;</span>He overtook them, and he spoke these words to them. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#xA0;</span>They said to him, &#x201C;Why does my lord speak such words as these? Far be it from your servants that they should do such a thing!  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#xA0;</span>Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks&#x2019; mouths, we brought again to you out of the land of Canaan. How then should we steal silver or gold out of your lord&#x2019;s house?  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#xA0;</span>With whomever of your servants it is found, let him die, and we also will be my lord&#x2019;s slaves.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#xA0;</span>He said, &#x201C;Now also let it be according to your words. He with whom it is found will be my slave; and you will be blameless.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#xA0;</span>Then they hurried, and each man took his sack down to the ground, and each man opened his sack.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#xA0;</span>He searched, beginning with the oldest, and ending at the youngest. The cup was found in Benjamin&#x2019;s sack.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#xA0;</span>Then they tore their clothes, and each man loaded his donkey, and returned to the city. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#xA0;</span>Judah and his brothers came to Joseph&#x2019;s house, and he was still there. They fell on the ground before him.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#xA0;</span>Joseph said to them, &#x201C;What deed is this that you have done? Don&#x2019;t you know that such a man as I can indeed do divination?&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#xA0;</span>Judah said, &#x201C;What will we tell my lord? What will we speak? How will we clear ourselves? God has found out the iniquity of your servants.
