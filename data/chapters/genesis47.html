There is nothing left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies, and our lands.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#xA0;</span>Why should we die before your eyes, both we and our land?

Behold, here is seed for you, and you shall sow the land.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#xA0;</span>It will happen at the harvests, that you shall give a fifth to Pharaoh, and four parts will be your own, for seed of the field, for your food, for them of your households, and for food for your little ones.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#xA0;</span>They said, &#x201C;You have saved our lives!
