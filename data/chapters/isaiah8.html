Dress for battle, and be shattered!  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#xA0;</span>Take counsel together, and it will be brought to nothing; speak the word, and it will not stand, for God is with us.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#xA0;</span>For the LORD spoke this to me with a strong hand, and instructed me not to walk in the way of this people, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#xA0;</span>&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t call a conspiracy all that this people call a conspiracy. Don&#x2019;t fear their threats or be terrorised.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#xA0;</span>The LORD of Armies is who you must respect as holy. He is the one you must fear. He is the one you must dread.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#xA0;</span>He will be a sanctuary, but for both houses of Israel, he will be a stumbling stone and a rock that makes them fall. For the people of Jerusalem, he will be a trap and a snare.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#xA0;</span>Many will stumble over it, fall, be broken, be snared, and be captured.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#xA0;</span>Wrap up the covenant.
