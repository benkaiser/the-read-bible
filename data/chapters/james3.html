Anyone who doesn&#x2019;t stumble in word is a perfect person, able to bridle the whole body also.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#xA0;</span>Indeed, we put bits into the horses&#x2019; mouths so that they may obey us, and we guide their whole body.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#xA0;</span>Behold,<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> &#x201C;Behold&#x201D;, from &#x201C;&#x1F30;&#x3B4;&#x3BF;&#x1F7A;&#x201D;, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at. It is often used as an interjection.</span></a> the ships also, though they are so big and are driven by fierce winds, are yet guided by a very small rudder, wherever the pilot desires.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#xA0;</span>So the tongue is also a little member, and boasts great things. See how a small fire can spread to a large forest!  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#xA0;</span>And the tongue is a fire. The world of iniquity amongst our members is the tongue, which defiles the whole body, and sets on fire the course of nature, and is set on fire by Gehenna.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">&#x2020;<span class="popup"> or, Hell</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#xA0;</span>For every kind of animal, bird, creeping thing, and sea creature is tamed, and has been tamed by mankind;  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#xA0;</span>but nobody can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#xA0;</span>With it we bless our God and Father, and with it we curse men who are made in the image of God.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#xA0;</span>Out of the same mouth comes blessing and cursing. My brothers, these things ought not to be so.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#xA0;</span>Does a spring send out from the same opening fresh and bitter water?  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#xA0;</span>Can a fig tree, my brothers, yield olives, or a vine figs? Thus no spring yields both salt water and fresh water. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#xA0;</span>Who is wise and understanding amongst you? Let him show by his good conduct that his deeds are done in gentleness of wisdom.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#xA0;</span>But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your heart, don&#x2019;t boast and don&#x2019;t lie against the truth.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#xA0;</span>This wisdom is not that which comes down from above, but is earthly, sensual, and demonic.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#xA0;</span>For where jealousy and selfish ambition are, there is confusion and every evil deed.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#xA0;</span>But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceful, gentle, reasonable, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#xA0;</span>Now the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace. </div>
