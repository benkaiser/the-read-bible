If anyone trusts in himself that he is Christ&#x2019;s, let him consider this again with himself, that even as he is Christ&#x2019;s, so we also are Christ&#x2019;s.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#xA0;</span>For even if I boast somewhat abundantly concerning our authority, which the Lord gave for building you up and not for casting you down, I will not be ashamed,  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#xA0;</span>that I may not seem as if I desire to terrify you by my letters.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#xA0;</span>For, &#x201C;His letters&#x201D;, they say, &#x201C;are weighty and strong, but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech is despised.&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#xA0;</span>Let such a person consider this, that what we are in word by letters when we are absent, such are we also in deed when we are present. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#xA0;</span>For we are not bold to number or compare ourselves with some of those who commend themselves. But they themselves, measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves with themselves, are without understanding.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#xA0;</span>But we will not boast beyond proper limits, but within the boundaries with which God appointed to us, which reach even to you.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#xA0;</span>For we don&#x2019;t stretch ourselves too much, as though we didn&#x2019;t reach to you. For we came even as far as to you with the Good News of Christ,  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#xA0;</span>not boasting beyond proper limits in other men&#x2019;s labours, but having hope that as your faith grows, we will be abundantly enlarged by you in our sphere of influence,  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#xA0;</span>so as to preach the Good News even to the parts beyond you, not to boast in what someone else has already done.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#xA0;</span>But &#x201C;he who boasts, let him boast in the Lord.&#x201D;<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">&#x2721;<span class="popup"> Jeremiah 9:24 </span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#xA0;</span>For it isn&#x2019;t he who commends himself who is approved, but whom the Lord commends. </div>
