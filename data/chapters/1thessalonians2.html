But wrath has come on them to the uttermost. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#xA0;</span>But we, brothers, being bereaved of you for a short season in presence, not in heart, tried even harder to see your face with great desire,  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#xA0;</span>because we wanted to come to you&#x2014;indeed, I, Paul, once and again&#x2014;but Satan hindered us.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#xA0;</span>For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Isn&#x2019;t it even you, before our Lord Jesus<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> TR adds &#x201C;Christ&#x201D;</span></a> at his coming?  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#xA0;</span>For you are our glory and our joy. </div>
