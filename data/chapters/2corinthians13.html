For we also are weak in him, but we will live with him through the power of God towards you. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#xA0;</span>Examine your own selves, whether you are in the faith. Test your own selves. Or don&#x2019;t you know about your own selves, that Jesus Christ is in you?&#x2014;unless indeed you are disqualified.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#xA0;</span>But I hope that you will know that we aren&#x2019;t disqualified. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#xA0;</span>Now I pray to God that you do no evil; not that we may appear approved, but that you may do that which is honourable, though we may seem to have failed.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#xA0;</span>For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#xA0;</span>For we rejoice when we are weak and you are strong. We also pray for this: your becoming perfect.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#xA0;</span>For this cause I write these things while absent, that I may not deal sharply when present, according to the authority which the Lord gave me for building up and not for tearing down. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#xA0;</span>Finally, brothers, rejoice!
