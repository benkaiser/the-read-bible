There they shall lay the most holy things, with the meal offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering; for the place is holy.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#xA0;</span>When the priests enter in, then they shall not go out of the holy place into the outer court until they lay their garments in which they minister there; for they are holy.
