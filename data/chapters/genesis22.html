He split the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went to the place of which God had told him.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#xA0;</span>On the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place far off.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#xA0;</span>Abraham said to his young men, &#x201C;Stay here with the donkey. The boy and I will go over there. We will worship, and come back to you.&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#xA0;</span>Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it on Isaac his son.

Abraham built the altar there, and laid the wood in order, bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar, on the wood.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#xA0;</span>Abraham stretched out his hand, and took the knife to kill his son. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#xA0;</span>The LORD&#x2019;s angel called to him out of the sky, and said, &#x201C;Abraham, Abraham!&#x201D; </div><div class="p">He said, &#x201C;Here I am.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#xA0;</span>He said, &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t lay your hand on the boy or do anything to him.
