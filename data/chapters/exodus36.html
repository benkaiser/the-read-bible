They kept bringing free will offerings to him every morning.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#xA0;</span>All the wise men, who performed all the work of the sanctuary, each came from his work which he did.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#xA0;</span>They spoke to Moses, saying, &#x201C;The people have brought much more than enough for the service of the work which the LORD commanded to make.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#xA0;</span>Moses gave a commandment, and they caused it to be proclaimed throughout the camp, saying, &#x201C;Let neither man nor woman make anything else for the offering for the sanctuary.&#x201D; So the people were restrained from bringing.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#xA0;</span>For the stuff they had was sufficient to do all the work, and too much. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#xA0;</span>All the wise-hearted men amongst those who did the work made the tabernacle with ten curtains of fine twined linen, blue, purple, and scarlet.

Likewise he made in the edge of the curtain that was outermost in the second coupling.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#xA0;</span>He made fifty loops in the one curtain, and he made fifty loops in the edge of the curtain that was in the second coupling. The loops were opposite to one another.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#xA0;</span>He made fifty clasps of gold, and coupled the curtains to one another with the clasps: so the tabernacle was a unit. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#xA0;</span>He made curtains of goats&#x2019; hair for a covering over the tabernacle.
