So they came in and stood before the king.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#xA0;</span>The king said to them, &#x201C;I have dreamt a dream, and my spirit is troubled to know the dream.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#xA0;</span>Then the Chaldeans spoke to the king in the Syrian language, &#x201C;O king, live forever!
