All Judah brought tribute to Jehoshaphat, and he had riches and honour in abundance.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#xA0;</span>His heart was lifted up in the ways of the LORD. Furthermore, he took away the high places and the Asherah poles out of Judah. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#xA0;</span>Also in the third year of his reign he sent his princes, even Ben Hail, Obadiah, Zechariah, Nethanel, and Micaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah;  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#xA0;</span>and with them Levites, even Shemaiah, Nethaniah, Zebadiah, Asahel, Shemiramoth, Jehonathan, Adonijah, Tobijah, and Tobadonijah, the Levites; and with them Elishama and Jehoram, the priests.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#xA0;</span>They taught in Judah, having the book of the LORD&#x2019;s law with them. They went about throughout all the cities of Judah and taught amongst the people. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#xA0;</span>The fear of the LORD fell on all the kingdoms of the lands that were around Judah, so that they made no war against Jehoshaphat.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#xA0;</span>Some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents and silver for tribute. The Arabians also brought him flocks: seven thousand and seven hundred rams and seven thousand and seven hundred male goats.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#xA0;</span>Jehoshaphat grew great exceedingly; and he built fortresses and store cities in Judah.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#xA0;</span>He had many works in the cities of Judah; and men of war, mighty men of valour, in Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#xA0;</span>This was the numbering of them according to their fathers&#x2019; houses: From Judah, the captains of thousands: Adnah the captain, and with him three hundred thousand mighty men of valour;  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#xA0;</span>and next to him Jehohanan the captain, and with him two hundred and eighty thousand;  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#xA0;</span>and next to him Amasiah the son of Zichri, who willingly offered himself to the LORD, and with him two hundred thousand mighty men of valour.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#xA0;</span>From Benjamin: Eliada, a mighty man of valour, and with him two hundred thousand armed with bow and shield;  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#xA0;</span>and next to him Jehozabad, and with him one hundred and eighty thousand ready and prepared for war.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#xA0;</span>These were those who waited on the king, in addition to those whom the king put in the fortified cities throughout all Judah. </div>
