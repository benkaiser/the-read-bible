There was written, &#x201C;JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#xA0;</span>Therefore many of the Jews read this title, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and it was written in Hebrew, in Latin, and in Greek.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#xA0;</span>The chief priests of the Jews therefore said to Pilate, &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t write, &#x2018;The King of the Jews,&#x2019; but, &#x2018;he said, &#x201C;I am King of the Jews.&#x201D;&#xA0;&#x2019;&#xA0;&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#xA0;</span>Pilate answered, &#x201C;What I have written, I have written.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#xA0;</span>Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also the tunic. Now the tunic was without seam, woven from the top throughout.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#xA0;</span>Then they said to one another, &#x201C;Let&#x2019;s not tear it, but cast lots for it to decide whose it will be,&#x201D; that the Scripture might be fulfilled, which says, </div><div class="q">&#x201C;They parted my garments amongst them. </div><div class="q2">They cast lots for my clothing.&#x201D;<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">&#x2721;<span class="popup"> Psalm 22:18</span></a> </div><div class="m">Therefore the soldiers did these things. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#xA0;</span>But standing by Jesus&#x2019; cross were his mother, his mother&#x2019;s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#xA0;</span>Therefore when Jesus saw his mother, and the disciple whom he loved standing there, he said to his mother, <span class="wj">&#x201C;Woman, behold, your son!&#x201D; </span>  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#xA0;</span>Then he said to the disciple, <span class="wj">&#x201C;Behold, your mother!&#x201D;</span> From that hour, the disciple took her to his own home. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#xA0;</span>After this, Jesus, seeing<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">&#x2020;<span class="popup"> NU, TR read &#x201C;knowing&#x201D; instead of &#x201C;seeing&#x201D; </span></a> that all things were now finished, that the Scripture might be fulfilled, said, <span class="wj">&#x201C;I am thirsty!&#x201D;</span>  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#xA0;</span>Now a vessel full of vinegar was set there; so they put a sponge full of the vinegar on hyssop, and held it at his mouth.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#xA0;</span>When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, <span class="wj">&#x201C;It is finished!&#x201D;</span> Then he bowed his head and gave up his spirit. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#xA0;</span>Therefore the Jews, because it was the Preparation Day, so that the bodies wouldn&#x2019;t remain on the cross on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a special one), asked of Pilate that their legs might be broken and that they might be taken away.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#xA0;</span>Therefore the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first and of the other who was crucified with him;  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#xA0;</span>but when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they didn&#x2019;t break his legs.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#xA0;</span>However, one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and immediately blood and water came out.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#xA0;</span>He who has seen has testified, and his testimony is true.

Pilate gave him permission. He came therefore and took away his body.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#xA0;</span>Nicodemus, who at first came to Jesus by night, also came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred Roman pounds.<a href="#FN6" class="notemark">&#x2021;<span class="popup"> 100 Roman pounds of 12 ounces each, or about 72 pounds, or 33 Kilograms.</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#xA0;</span>So they took Jesus&#x2019; body, and bound it in linen cloths with the spices, as the custom of the Jews is to bury.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#xA0;</span>Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden. In the garden was a new tomb in which no man had ever yet been laid.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#xA0;</span>Then, because of the Jews&#x2019; Preparation Day (for the tomb was near at hand), they laid Jesus there. </div>
