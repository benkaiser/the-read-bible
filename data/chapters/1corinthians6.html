And if the world is judged by you, are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters?  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#xA0;</span>Don&#x2019;t you know that we will judge angels? How much more, things that pertain to this life?  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#xA0;</span>If then you have to judge things pertaining to this life, do you set them to judge who are of no account in the assembly?  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#xA0;</span>I say this to move you to shame. Isn&#x2019;t there even one wise man amongst you who would be able to decide between his brothers?  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#xA0;</span>But brother goes to law with brother, and that before unbelievers!  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#xA0;</span>Therefore it is already altogether a defect in you that you have lawsuits one with another. Why not rather be wronged? Why not rather be defrauded?  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#xA0;</span>No, but you yourselves do wrong and defraud, and that against your brothers. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#xA0;</span>Or don&#x2019;t you know that the unrighteous will not inherit God&#x2019;s Kingdom? Don&#x2019;t be deceived. Neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor male prostitutes, nor homosexuals,  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#xA0;</span>nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor slanderers, nor extortionists, will inherit God&#x2019;s Kingdom.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#xA0;</span>Some of you were such, but you were washed. You were sanctified. You were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and in the Spirit of our God. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#xA0;</span>&#x201C;All things are lawful for me,&#x201D; but not all things are expedient. &#x201C;All things are lawful for me,&#x201D; but I will not be brought under the power of anything.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#xA0;</span>&#x201C;Foods for the belly, and the belly for foods,&#x201D; but God will bring to nothing both it and them. But the body is not for sexual immorality, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#xA0;</span>Now God raised up the Lord, and will also raise us up by his power.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#xA0;</span>Don&#x2019;t you know that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ and make them members of a prostitute? May it never be!  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#xA0;</span>Or don&#x2019;t you know that he who is joined to a prostitute is one body? For, &#x201C;The two&#x201D;, he says, &#x201C;will become one flesh.&#x201D;<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">&#x2721;<span class="popup"> Genesis 2:24</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#xA0;</span>But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#xA0;</span>Flee sexual immorality! &#x201C;Every sin that a man does is outside the body,&#x201D; but he who commits sexual immorality sins against his own body.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#xA0;</span>Or don&#x2019;t you know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God? You are not your own,  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#xA0;</span>for you were bought with a price. Therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are God&#x2019;s. </div>
