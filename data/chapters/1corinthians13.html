But where there are prophecies, they will be done away with. Where there are various languages, they will cease. Where there is knowledge, it will be done away with.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#xA0;</span>For we know in part and we prophesy in part;  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#xA0;</span>but when that which is complete has come, then that which is partial will be done away with.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#xA0;</span>When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I felt as a child, I thought as a child. Now that I have become a man, I have put away childish things.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#xA0;</span>For now we see in a mirror, dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I will know fully, even as I was also fully known.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#xA0;</span>But now faith, hope, and love remain&#x2014;these three. The greatest of these is love. </div>
