They broke his altars and his images in pieces thoroughly, and killed Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars. The priest appointed officers over the LORD&#x2019;s house.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#xA0;</span>He took the captains over hundreds, and the Carites, and the guard, and all the people of the land; and they brought down the king from the LORD&#x2019;s house, and came by the way of the gate of the guard to the king&#x2019;s house.
