You have caused your days to draw near, and have come to the end of your years.

Another in you has humbled his sister, his father&#x2019;s daughter.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#xA0;</span>In you have they taken bribes to shed blood. You have taken interest and increase, and you have greedily gained of your neighbours by oppression, and have forgotten me,&#x201D; says the Lord GOD. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#xA0;</span>&#x201C;&#xA0;&#x2018;&#xA0;&#x201C;Behold, therefore I have struck my hand at your dishonest gain which you have made, and at the blood which has been shed within you.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#xA0;</span>Can your heart endure, or can your hands be strong, in the days that I will deal with you?
