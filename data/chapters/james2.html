Didn&#x2019;t God choose those who are poor in this world to be rich in faith and heirs of the Kingdom which he promised to those who love him?  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#xA0;</span>But you have dishonoured the poor man. Don&#x2019;t the rich oppress you and personally drag you before the courts?  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#xA0;</span>Don&#x2019;t they blaspheme the honourable name by which you are called? </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#xA0;</span>However, if you fulfil the royal law according to the Scripture, &#x201C;You shall love your neighbour as yourself,&#x201D;<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">&#x2721;<span class="popup"> Leviticus 19:18</span></a> you do well.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#xA0;</span>But if you show partiality, you commit sin, being convicted by the law as transgressors.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#xA0;</span>For whoever keeps the whole law, and yet stumbles in one point, he has become guilty of all.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#xA0;</span>For he who said, &#x201C;Do not commit adultery,&#x201D;<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">&#x2721;<span class="popup"> Exodus 20:14; Deuteronomy 5:18</span></a> also said, &#x201C;Do not commit murder.&#x201D;<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">&#x2721;<span class="popup"> Exodus 20:13; Deuteronomy 5:17 </span></a> Now if you do not commit adultery but do murder, you have become a transgressor of the law.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#xA0;</span>So speak and so do as men who are to be judged by the law of freedom.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#xA0;</span>For judgement is without mercy to him who has shown no mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgement. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#xA0;</span>What good is it, my brothers, if a man says he has faith, but has no works? Can faith save him?  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#xA0;</span>And if a brother or sister is naked and in lack of daily food,  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#xA0;</span>and one of you tells them, &#x201C;Go in peace. Be warmed and filled;&#x201D; yet you didn&#x2019;t give them the things the body needs, what good is it?  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#xA0;</span>Even so faith, if it has no works, is dead in itself.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#xA0;</span>Yes, a man will say, &#x201C;You have faith, and I have works.&#x201D; Show me your faith without works, and I will show you my faith by my works. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#xA0;</span>You believe that God is one. You do well. The demons also believe&#x2014;and shudder.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#xA0;</span>But do you want to know, vain man, that faith apart from works is dead?  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#xA0;</span>Wasn&#x2019;t Abraham our father justified by works, in that he offered up Isaac his son on the altar?  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#xA0;</span>You see that faith worked with his works, and by works faith was perfected.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#xA0;</span>So the Scripture was fulfilled which says, &#x201C;Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him as righteousness,&#x201D;<a href="#FN5" class="notemark">&#x2721;<span class="popup"> Genesis 15:6</span></a> and he was called the friend of God.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#xA0;</span>You see then that by works a man is justified, and not only by faith.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#xA0;</span>In the same way, wasn&#x2019;t Rahab the prostitute also justified by works when she received the messengers and sent them out another way?  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#xA0;</span>For as the body apart from the spirit is dead, even so faith apart from works is dead. </div>
