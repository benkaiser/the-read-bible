For I also am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#xA0;</span>God didn&#x2019;t reject his people, whom he foreknew. Or don&#x2019;t you know what the Scripture says about Elijah? How he pleads with God against Israel:  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#xA0;</span>&#x201C;Lord, they have killed your prophets. They have broken down your altars. I am left alone, and they seek my life.&#x201D;<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">&#x2721;<span class="popup"> 1 Kings 19:10,14</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#xA0;</span>But how does God answer him? &#x201C;I have reserved for myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Baal.&#x201D;<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">&#x2721;<span class="popup"> 1 Kings 19:18</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#xA0;</span>Even so too at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#xA0;</span>And if by grace, then it is no longer of works; otherwise grace is no longer grace.

That which Israel seeks for, that he didn&#x2019;t obtain, but the chosen ones obtained it, and the rest were hardened.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#xA0;</span>According as it is written, &#x201C;God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear, to this very day.&#x201D; <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">&#x2721;<span class="popup"> Deuteronomy 29:4; Isaiah 29:10</span></a> </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#xA0;</span>David says, </div><div class="q">&#x201C;Let their table be made a snare, a trap, </div><div class="q2">a stumbling block, and a retribution to them. </div><div class="q"> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#xA0;</span>Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see. </div><div class="q2">Always keep their backs bent.&#x201D;<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">&#x2721;<span class="popup"> Psalm 69:22,23</span></a> </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#xA0;</span>I ask then, did they stumble that they might fall?
