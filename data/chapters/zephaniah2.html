Seek righteousness. Seek humility. It may be that you will be hidden in the day of the LORD&#x2019;s anger.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#xA0;</span>For Gaza will be forsaken, and Ashkelon a desolation. They will drive out Ashdod at noonday, and Ekron will be rooted up.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#xA0;</span>Woe to the inhabitants of the sea coast, the nation of the Cherethites! The LORD&#x2019;s word is against you, Canaan, the land of the Philistines. I will destroy you until there is no inhabitant.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#xA0;</span>The sea coast will be pastures, with cottages for shepherds and folds for flocks.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#xA0;</span>The coast will be for the remnant of the house of Judah.
