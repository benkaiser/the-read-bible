</div><div class="chapterlabel" id="V0"> 1</div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#xA0;</span>Paul, an apostle&#x2014;not from men, nor through man, but through Jesus Christ,<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> &#x201C;Christ&#x201D; means &#x201C;Anointed One&#x201D;.</span></a> and God the Father, who raised him from the dead&#x2014;  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#xA0;</span>and all the brothers<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">&#x2020;<span class="popup"> The word for &#x201C;brothers&#x201D; here and where context allows may also be correctly translated &#x201C;brothers and sisters&#x201D; or &#x201C;siblings.&#x201D; </span></a> who are with me, to the assemblies of Galatia:  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#xA0;</span>Grace to you and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ,  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#xA0;</span>who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us out of this present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father&#x2014;  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#xA0;</span>to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#xA0;</span>I marvel that you are so quickly deserting him who called you in the grace of Christ to a different &#x201C;good news&#x201D;,  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#xA0;</span>but there isn&#x2019;t another &#x201C;good news.&#x201D; Only there are some who trouble you and want to pervert the Good News of Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#xA0;</span>But even though we, or an angel from heaven, should preach to you any &#x201C;good news&#x201D; other than that which we preached to you, let him be cursed.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#xA0;</span>As we have said before, so I now say again: if any man preaches to you any &#x201C;good news&#x201D; other than that which you received, let him be cursed. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#xA0;</span>For am I now seeking the favour of men, or of God? Or am I striving to please men? For if I were still pleasing men, I wouldn&#x2019;t be a servant of Christ. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#xA0;</span>But I make known to you, brothers, concerning the Good News which was preached by me, that it is not according to man.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#xA0;</span>For I didn&#x2019;t receive it from man, nor was I taught it, but it came to me through revelation of Jesus Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#xA0;</span>For you have heard of my way of living in time past in the Jews&#x2019; religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the assembly of God and ravaged it.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#xA0;</span>I advanced in the Jews&#x2019; religion beyond many of my own age amongst my countrymen, being more exceedingly zealous for the traditions of my fathers.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#xA0;</span>But when it was the good pleasure of God, who separated me from my mother&#x2019;s womb and called me through his grace,  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#xA0;</span>to reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him amongst the Gentiles, I didn&#x2019;t immediately confer with flesh and blood,  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#xA0;</span>nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me, but I went away into Arabia. Then I returned to Damascus. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#xA0;</span>Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Peter, and stayed with him fifteen days.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#xA0;</span>But of the other apostles I saw no one except James, the Lord&#x2019;s brother.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#xA0;</span>Now about the things which I write to you, behold,<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">&#x2021;<span class="popup"> &#x201C;Behold&#x201D;, from &#x201C;&#x1F30;&#x3B4;&#x3BF;&#x1F7A;&#x201D;, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at. It is often used as an interjection.</span></a> before God, I&#x2019;m not lying.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#xA0;</span>Then I came to the regions of Syria and Cilicia.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#xA0;</span>I was still unknown by face to the assemblies of Judea which were in Christ,  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#xA0;</span>but they only heard, &#x201C;He who once persecuted us now preaches the faith that he once tried to destroy.&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#xA0;</span>So they glorified God in me. </div>
