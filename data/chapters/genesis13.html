There Abram called on the LORD&#x2019;s name.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#xA0;</span>Lot also, who went with Abram, had flocks, herds, and tents.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#xA0;</span>The land was not able to bear them, that they might live together; for their possessions were so great that they couldn&#x2019;t live together.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#xA0;</span>There was strife between the herdsmen of Abram&#x2019;s livestock and the herdsmen of Lot&#x2019;s livestock. The Canaanites and the Perizzites lived in the land at that time.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#xA0;</span>Abram said to Lot, &#x201C;Please, let there be no strife between you and me, and between your herdsmen and my herdsmen; for we are relatives.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#xA0;</span>Isn&#x2019;t the whole land before you? Please separate yourself from me. If you go to the left hand, then I will go to the right. Or if you go to the right hand, then I will go to the left.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#xA0;</span>Lot lifted up his eyes, and saw all the plain of the Jordan, that it was well-watered everywhere, before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, like the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt, as you go to Zoar.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#xA0;</span>So Lot chose the Plain of the Jordan for himself. Lot travelled east, and they separated themselves from one other.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#xA0;</span>Abram lived in the land of Canaan, and Lot lived in the cities of the plain, and moved his tent as far as Sodom.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#xA0;</span>Now the men of Sodom were exceedingly wicked and sinners against the LORD. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#xA0;</span>The LORD said to Abram, after Lot was separated from him, &#x201C;Now, lift up your eyes, and look from the place where you are, northward and southward and eastward and westward,  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#xA0;</span>for I will give all the land which you see to you and to your offspring forever.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#xA0;</span>I will make your offspring as the dust of the earth, so that if a man can count the dust of the earth, then your offspring may also be counted.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#xA0;</span>Arise, walk through the land in its length and in its width; for I will give it to you.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#xA0;</span>Abram moved his tent, and came and lived by the oaks of Mamre, which are in Hebron, and built an altar there to the LORD. </div>
