He is risen from the dead. That is why these powers work in him.&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#xA0;</span>For Herod had arrested John, bound him, and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip&#x2019;s wife.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#xA0;</span>For John said to him, &#x201C;It is not lawful for you to have her.&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#xA0;</span>When he would have put him to death, he feared the multitude, because they counted him as a prophet.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#xA0;</span>But when Herod&#x2019;s birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced amongst them and pleased Herod.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#xA0;</span>Therefore he promised with an oath to give her whatever she should ask.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#xA0;</span>She, being prompted by her mother, said, &#x201C;Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptiser.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#xA0;</span>The king was grieved, but for the sake of his oaths and of those who sat at the table with him, he commanded it to be given,  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#xA0;</span>and he sent and beheaded John in the prison.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#xA0;</span>His head was brought on a platter and given to the young lady; and she brought it to her mother.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#xA0;</span>His disciples came, took the body, and buried it. Then they went and told Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#xA0;</span>Now when Jesus heard this, he withdrew from there in a boat to a deserted place apart. When the multitudes heard it, they followed him on foot from the cities. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#xA0;</span>Jesus went out, and he saw a great multitude.

When evening had come, he was there alone.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#xA0;</span>But the boat was now in the middle of the sea, distressed by the waves, for the wind was contrary.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#xA0;</span>In the fourth watch of the night,<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> The night was equally divided into four watches, so the fourth watch is approximately 3:00 a.m. to sunrise. </span></a> Jesus came to them, walking on the sea.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">&#x2721;<span class="popup"> See Job 9:8</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#xA0;</span>When the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, &#x201C;It&#x2019;s a ghost!&#x201D; and they cried out for fear.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#xA0;</span>But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, <span class="wj">&#x201C;Cheer up!
