Now David and his men were staying in the innermost parts of the cave.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#xA0;</span>David&#x2019;s men said to him, &#x201C;Behold, the day of which the LORD said to you, &#x2018;Behold, I will deliver your enemy into your hand, and you shall do to him as it shall seem good to you.&#x2019;&#xA0;&#x201D; Then David arose and cut off the skirt of Saul&#x2019;s robe secretly.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#xA0;</span>Afterward, David&#x2019;s heart struck him because he had cut off Saul&#x2019;s skirt.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#xA0;</span>He said to his men, &#x201C;The LORD forbid that I should do this thing to my lord, the LORD&#x2019;s anointed, to stretch out my hand against him, since he is the LORD&#x2019;s anointed.&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#xA0;</span>So David checked his men with these words, and didn&#x2019;t allow them to rise against Saul. Saul rose up out of the cave, and went on his way.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#xA0;</span>David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave and cried after Saul, saying, &#x201C;My lord the king!&#x201D; </div><div class="p">When Saul looked behind him, David bowed with his face to the earth, and showed respect.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#xA0;</span>David said to Saul, &#x201C;Why do you listen to men&#x2019;s words, saying, &#x2018;Behold, David seeks to harm you?&#x2019;  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#xA0;</span>Behold, today your eyes have seen how the LORD had delivered you today into my hand in the cave. Some urged me to kill you, but I spared you. I said, &#x2018;I will not stretch out my hand against my lord, for he is the LORD&#x2019;s anointed.&#x2019;  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#xA0;</span>Moreover, my father, behold, yes, see the skirt of your robe in my hand; for in that I cut off the skirt of your robe and didn&#x2019;t kill you, know and see that there is neither evil nor disobedience in my hand. I have not sinned against you, though you hunt for my life to take it.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#xA0;</span>May the LORD judge between me and you, and may the LORD avenge me of you; but my hand will not be on you.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#xA0;</span>As the proverb of the ancients says, &#x2018;Out of the wicked comes wickedness;&#x2019; but my hand will not be on you.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#xA0;</span>Against whom has the king of Israel come out? Whom do you pursue? A dead dog? A flea?  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#xA0;</span>May the LORD therefore be judge, and give sentence between me and you, and see, and plead my cause, and deliver me out of your hand.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#xA0;</span>It came to pass, when David had finished speaking these words to Saul, that Saul said, &#x201C;Is that your voice, my son David?&#x201D; Saul lifted up his voice and wept.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#xA0;</span>He said to David, &#x201C;You are more righteous than I; for you have done good to me, whereas I have done evil to you.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#xA0;</span>You have declared today how you have dealt well with me, because when the LORD had delivered me up into your hand, you didn&#x2019;t kill me.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#xA0;</span>For if a man finds his enemy, will he let him go away unharmed? Therefore may the LORD reward you good for that which you have done to me today.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#xA0;</span>Now, behold, I know that you will surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel will be established in your hand.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#xA0;</span>Swear now therefore to me by the LORD that you will not cut off my offspring after me, and that you will not destroy my name out of my father&#x2019;s house.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#xA0;</span>David swore to Saul. Saul went home, but David and his men went up to the stronghold. </div>
