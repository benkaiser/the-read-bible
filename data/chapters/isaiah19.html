The idols of Egypt will tremble at his presence; and the heart of Egypt will melt within it.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#xA0;</span>I will stir up the Egyptians against the Egyptians, and they will fight everyone against his brother, and everyone against his neighbour; city against city, and kingdom against kingdom.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#xA0;</span>The spirit of the Egyptians will fail within them. I will destroy their counsel. They will seek the idols, the charmers, those who have familiar spirits, and the wizards.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#xA0;</span>I will give over the Egyptians into the hand of a cruel lord. A fierce king will rule over them,&#x201D; says the Lord, the LORD of Armies. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#xA0;</span>The waters will fail from the sea, and the river will be wasted and become dry.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#xA0;</span>The rivers will become foul. The streams of Egypt will be diminished and dried up. The reeds and flags will wither away.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#xA0;</span>The meadows by the Nile, by the brink of the Nile, and all the sown fields of the Nile, will become dry, be driven away, and be no more.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#xA0;</span>The fishermen will lament, and all those who fish in the Nile will mourn, and those who spread nets on the waters will languish.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#xA0;</span>Moreover those who work in combed flax, and those who weave white cloth, will be confounded.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#xA0;</span>The pillars will be broken in pieces. All those who work for hire will be grieved in soul. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#xA0;</span>The princes of Zoan are utterly foolish. The counsel of the wisest counsellors of Pharaoh has become stupid. How do you say to Pharaoh, &#x201C;I am the son of the wise, the son of ancient kings?&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#xA0;</span>Where then are your wise men? Let them tell you now; and let them know what the LORD of Armies has purposed concerning Egypt.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#xA0;</span>The princes of Zoan have become fools. The princes of Memphis are deceived. They have caused Egypt to go astray, those who are the cornerstone of her tribes.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#xA0;</span>The LORD has mixed a spirit of perverseness in the middle of her; and they have caused Egypt to go astray in all of its works, like a drunken man staggers in his vomit.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#xA0;</span>Neither shall there be any work for Egypt, which head or tail, palm branch or rush, may do.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#xA0;</span>In that day the Egyptians will be like women. They will tremble and fear because of the shaking of the LORD of Armies&#x2019;s hand, which he shakes over them.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#xA0;</span>The land of Judah will become a terror to Egypt. Everyone to whom mention is made of it will be afraid, because of the plans of the LORD of Armies, which he determines against it.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#xA0;</span>In that day, there will be five cities in the land of Egypt that speak the language of Canaan, and swear to the LORD of Armies. One will be called &#x201C;The city of destruction.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#xA0;</span>In that day, there will be an altar to the LORD in the middle of the land of Egypt, and a pillar to the LORD at its border.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#xA0;</span>It will be for a sign and for a witness to the LORD of Armies in the land of Egypt; for they will cry to the LORD because of oppressors, and he will send them a saviour and a defender, and he will deliver them.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#xA0;</span>The LORD will be known to Egypt, and the Egyptians will know the LORD in that day. Yes, they will worship with sacrifice and offering, and will vow a vow to the LORD, and will perform it.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#xA0;</span>The LORD will strike Egypt, striking and healing. They will return to the LORD, and he will be entreated by them, and will heal them. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#xA0;</span>In that day there will be a highway out of Egypt to Assyria, and the Assyrian shall come into Egypt, and the Egyptian into Assyria; and the Egyptians will worship with the Assyrians. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#xA0;</span>In that day, Israel will be the third with Egypt and with Assyria, a blessing within the earth;  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#xA0;</span>because the LORD of Armies has blessed them, saying, &#x201C;Blessed be Egypt my people, Assyria the work of my hands, and Israel my inheritance.&#x201D; </div>
