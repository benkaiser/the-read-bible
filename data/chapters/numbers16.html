Why do you lift yourselves up above the LORD&#x2019;s assembly?&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#xA0;</span>When Moses heard it, he fell on his face.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#xA0;</span>He said to Korah and to all his company, &#x201C;In the morning, the LORD will show who are his, and who is holy, and will cause him to come near to him. Even him whom he shall choose, he will cause to come near to him.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#xA0;</span>Do this: have Korah and all his company take censers,  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#xA0;</span>put fire in them, and put incense on them before the LORD tomorrow.

Do you seek the priesthood also?  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#xA0;</span>Therefore you and all your company have gathered together against the LORD! What is Aaron that you complain against him?&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#xA0;</span>Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab; and they said, &#x201C;We won&#x2019;t come up!  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#xA0;</span>Is it a small thing that you have brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, but you must also make yourself a prince over us?  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#xA0;</span>Moreover you haven&#x2019;t brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey, nor given us inheritance of fields and vineyards. Will you put out the eyes of these men? We won&#x2019;t come up.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#xA0;</span>Moses was very angry, and said to the LORD, &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t respect their offering.
