I will make you a great name, like the name of the great ones who are in the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#xA0;</span>I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in their own place and be moved no more. The children of wickedness will not afflict them any more, as at the first,  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#xA0;</span>and as from the day that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel. I will cause you to rest from all your enemies. Moreover the LORD tells you that the LORD will make you a house.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#xA0;</span>When your days are fulfilled and you sleep with your fathers, I will set up your offspring after you, who will proceed out of your body, and I will establish his kingdom.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#xA0;</span>He will build a house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#xA0;</span>I will be his father, and he will be my son. If he commits iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men and with the stripes of the children of men;  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#xA0;</span>but my loving kindness will not depart from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I put away before you.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#xA0;</span>Your house and your kingdom will be made sure forever before you. Your throne will be established forever.&#x201D;&#xA0;&#x2019;&#xA0;&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#xA0;</span>Nathan spoke to David all these words, and according to all this vision. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#xA0;</span>Then David the king went in and sat before the LORD; and he said, &#x201C;Who am I, Lord<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> The word translated &#x201C;Lord&#x201D; is &#x201C;Adonai.&#x201D;</span></a> GOD, and what is my house, that you have brought me this far?  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#xA0;</span>This was yet a small thing in your eyes, Lord GOD, but you have spoken also of your servant&#x2019;s house for a great while to come; and this amongst men, Lord GOD!  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#xA0;</span>What more can David say to you?
