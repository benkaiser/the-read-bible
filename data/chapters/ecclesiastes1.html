</div><div class="chapterlabel" id="V0"> 1</div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#xA0;</span>The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem: </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#xA0;</span>&#x201C;Vanity of vanities,&#x201D; says the Preacher; &#x201C;Vanity of vanities, all is vanity.&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#xA0;</span>What does man gain from all his labour in which he labours under the sun?  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#xA0;</span>One generation goes, and another generation comes; but the earth remains forever.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#xA0;</span>The sun also rises, and the sun goes down, and hurries to its place where it rises.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#xA0;</span>The wind goes towards the south, and turns around to the north. It turns around continually as it goes, and the wind returns again to its courses.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#xA0;</span>All the rivers run into the sea, yet the sea is not full. To the place where the rivers flow, there they flow again.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#xA0;</span>All things are full of weariness beyond uttering. The eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#xA0;</span>That which has been is that which shall be, and that which has been done is that which shall be done; and there is no new thing under the sun.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#xA0;</span>Is there a thing of which it may be said, &#x201C;Behold,<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> &#x201C;Behold&#x201D;, from &#x201C;&#x5D4;&#x5B4;&#x5E0;&#x5B5;&#x5BC;&#x5D4;&#x201D;, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at. It is often used as an interjection.</span></a> this is new?&#x201D; It has been long ago, in the ages which were before us.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#xA0;</span>There is no memory of the former; neither shall there be any memory of the latter that are to come, amongst those that shall come after. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#xA0;</span>I, the Preacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#xA0;</span>I applied my heart to seek and to search out by wisdom concerning all that is done under the sky. It is a heavy burden that God<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">&#x2020;<span class="popup"> The Hebrew word rendered &#x201C;God&#x201D; is &#x201C;&#x5D0;&#x5B1;&#x5DC;&#x5B9;&#x5D4;&#x5B4;&#x591;&#x5D9;&#x5DD;&#x201D; (Elohim).</span></a> has given to the sons of men to be afflicted with.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#xA0;</span>I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and behold, all is vanity and a chasing after wind.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#xA0;</span>That which is crooked can&#x2019;t be made straight; and that which is lacking can&#x2019;t be counted.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#xA0;</span>I said to myself, &#x201C;Behold, I have obtained for myself great wisdom above all who were before me in Jerusalem. Yes, my heart has had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#xA0;</span>I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly. I perceived that this also was a chasing after wind.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#xA0;</span>For in much wisdom is much grief; and he who increases knowledge increases sorrow. </div>
