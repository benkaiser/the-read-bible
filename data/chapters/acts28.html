Paul entered in to him, prayed, and laying his hands on him, healed him.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#xA0;</span>Then when this was done, the rest also who had diseases in the island came and were cured.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#xA0;</span>They also honoured us with many honours; and when we sailed, they put on board the things that we needed. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#xA0;</span>After three months, we set sail in a ship of Alexandria which had wintered in the island, whose figurehead was &#x201C;The Twin Brothers.&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#xA0;</span>Touching at Syracuse, we stayed there three days.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#xA0;</span>From there we circled around and arrived at Rhegium. After one day, a south wind sprang up, and on the second day we came to Puteoli,  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#xA0;</span>where we found brothers,<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">&#x2020;<span class="popup"> The word for &#x201C;brothers&#x201D; here and where context allows may also be correctly translated &#x201C;brothers and sisters&#x201D; or &#x201C;siblings.&#x201D;</span></a> and were entreated to stay with them for seven days. So we came to Rome.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#xA0;</span>From there the brothers, when they heard of us, came to meet us as far as The Market of Appius and The Three Taverns. When Paul saw them, he thanked God and took courage.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#xA0;</span>When we entered into Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard, but Paul was allowed to stay by himself with the soldier who guarded him. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#xA0;</span>After three days Paul called together those who were the leaders of the Jews. When they had come together, he said to them, &#x201C;I, brothers, though I had done nothing against the people or the customs of our fathers, still was delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans,  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#xA0;</span>who, when they had examined me, desired to set me free, because there was no cause of death in me.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#xA0;</span>But when the Jews spoke against it, I was constrained to appeal to Caesar, not that I had anything about which to accuse my nation.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#xA0;</span>For this cause therefore I asked to see you and to speak with you. For because of the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#xA0;</span>They said to him, &#x201C;We neither received letters from Judea concerning you, nor did any of the brothers come here and report or speak any evil of you.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#xA0;</span>But we desire to hear from you what you think. For, as concerning this sect, it is known to us that everywhere it is spoken against.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#xA0;</span>When they had appointed him a day, many people came to him at his lodging. He explained to them, testifying about God&#x2019;s Kingdom, and persuading them concerning Jesus, both from the law of Moses and from the prophets, from morning until evening.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#xA0;</span>Some believed the things which were spoken, and some disbelieved.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#xA0;</span>When they didn&#x2019;t agree amongst themselves, they departed after Paul had spoken one message: &#x201C;The Holy Spirit spoke rightly through Isaiah the prophet to our fathers,  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#xA0;</span>saying, </div><div class="q">&#x2018;Go to this people and say, </div><div class="q">in hearing, you will hear, </div><div class="q2">but will in no way understand. </div><div class="q">In seeing, you will see, </div><div class="q2">but will in no way perceive. </div><div class="q"> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#xA0;</span>For this people&#x2019;s heart has grown callous. </div><div class="q2">Their ears are dull of hearing. </div><div class="q2">Their eyes they have closed. </div><div class="q">Lest they should see with their eyes, </div><div class="q2">hear with their ears, </div><div class="q2">understand with their heart, </div><div class="q2">and would turn again, </div><div class="q2">then I would heal them.&#x2019;<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">&#x2721;<span class="popup"> Isaiah 6:9-10</span></a> </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#xA0;</span>&#x201C;Be it known therefore to you that the salvation of God is sent to the nations, and they will listen.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#xA0;</span>When he had said these words, the Jews departed, having a great dispute amongst themselves.<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">&#x2021;<span class="popup"> NU omits verse 29.</span></a> </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#xA0;</span>Paul stayed two whole years in his own rented house and received all who were coming to him,  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#xA0;</span>preaching God&#x2019;s Kingdom and teaching the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness, without hindrance. </div>
