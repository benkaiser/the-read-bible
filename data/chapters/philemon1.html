Therefore receive him, that is, my own heart,  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#xA0;</span>whom I desired to keep with me, that on your behalf he might serve me in my chains for the Good News.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#xA0;</span>But I was willing to do nothing without your consent, that your goodness would not be as of necessity, but of free will.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#xA0;</span>For perhaps he was therefore separated from you for a while that you would have him forever,  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#xA0;</span>no longer as a slave, but more than a slave, a beloved brother&#x2014;especially to me, but how much rather to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#xA0;</span>If then you count me a partner, receive him as you would receive me.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#xA0;</span>But if he has wronged you at all or owes you anything, put that to my account.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#xA0;</span>I, Paul, write this with my own hand: I will repay it (not to mention to you that you owe to me even your own self besides).  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#xA0;</span>Yes, brother, let me have joy from you in the Lord. Refresh my heart in the Lord. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#xA0;</span>Having confidence in your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even beyond what I say. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#xA0;</span>Also, prepare a guest room for me, for I hope that through your prayers I will be restored to you. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#xA0;</span>Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you,  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#xA0;</span>as do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#xA0;</span>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
