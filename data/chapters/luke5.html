He sat down and taught the multitudes from the boat. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#xA0;</span>When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, <span class="wj">&#x201C;Put out into the deep and let down your nets for a catch.&#x201D;</span> </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#xA0;</span>Simon answered him, &#x201C;Master, we worked all night and caught nothing; but at your word I will let down the net.&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#xA0;</span>When they had done this, they caught a great multitude of fish, and their net was breaking.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#xA0;</span>They beckoned to their partners in the other boat, that they should come and help them. They came and filled both boats, so that they began to sink.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#xA0;</span>But Simon Peter, when he saw it, fell down at Jesus&#x2019; knees, saying, &#x201C;Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, Lord.&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#xA0;</span>For he was amazed, and all who were with him, at the catch of fish which they had caught;  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#xA0;</span>and so also were James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. </div><div class="p">Jesus said to Simon, <span class="wj">&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t be afraid. From now on you will be catching people alive.&#x201D;</span> </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#xA0;</span>When they had brought their boats to land, they left everything, and followed him. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#xA0;</span>While he was in one of the cities, behold, there was a man full of leprosy.

There was a great crowd of tax collectors and others who were reclining with them.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#xA0;</span>Their scribes and the Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying, &#x201C;Why do you eat and drink with the tax collectors and sinners?&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#xA0;</span>Jesus answered them, <span class="wj">&#x201C;Those who are healthy have no need for a physician, but those who are sick do. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#xA0;</span> <span class="wj">I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners, to repentance.&#x201D; </span> </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#xA0;</span>They said to him, &#x201C;Why do John&#x2019;s disciples often fast and pray, likewise also the disciples of the Pharisees, but yours eat and drink?&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#xA0;</span>He said to them, <span class="wj">&#x201C;Can you make the friends of the bridegroom fast while the bridegroom is with them? </span>  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#xA0;</span> <span class="wj">But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them.
