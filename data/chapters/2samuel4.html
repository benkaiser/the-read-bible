The name of one was Baanah and the name of the other Rechab, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin (for Beeroth also is considered a part of Benjamin;  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#xA0;</span>and the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and have lived as foreigners there until today). </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#xA0;</span>Now Jonathan, Saul&#x2019;s son, had a son who was lame in his feet.
