Again I will say, &#x201C;Rejoice!&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#xA0;</span>Let your gentleness be known to all men. The Lord is at hand.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#xA0;</span>In nothing be anxious, but in everything, by prayer and petition with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#xA0;</span>And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#xA0;</span>Finally, brothers, whatever things are true, whatever things are honourable, whatever things are just, whatever things are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever things are of good report: if there is any virtue and if there is anything worthy of praise, think about these things.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#xA0;</span>Do the things which you learnt, received, heard, and saw in me, and the God of peace will be with you. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#xA0;</span>But I rejoice in the Lord greatly that now at length you have revived your thought for me; in which you did indeed take thought, but you lacked opportunity.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#xA0;</span>Not that I speak because of lack, for I have learnt in whatever state I am, to be content in it.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#xA0;</span>I know how to be humbled, and I also know how to abound. In any and all circumstances I have learnt the secret both to be filled and to be hungry, both to abound and to be in need.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#xA0;</span>I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#xA0;</span>However you did well that you shared in my affliction.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#xA0;</span>You yourselves also know, you Philippians, that in the beginning of the Good News, when I departed from Macedonia, no assembly shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving but you only.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#xA0;</span>For even in Thessalonica you sent once and again to my need.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#xA0;</span>Not that I seek for the gift, but I seek for the fruit that increases to your account.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#xA0;</span>But I have all things and abound. I am filled, having received from Epaphroditus the things that came from you, a sweet-smelling fragrance, an acceptable and well-pleasing sacrifice to God.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#xA0;</span>My God will supply every need of yours according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#xA0;</span>Now to our God and Father be the glory forever and ever!
