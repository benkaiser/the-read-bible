It will also come on the land for seven years.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#xA0;</span>The woman arose, and did according to the man of God&#x2019;s word. She went with her household, and lived in the land of the Philistines for seven years.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#xA0;</span>At the end of seven years, the woman returned from the land of the Philistines. Then she went out to beg the king for her house and for her land.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#xA0;</span>Now the king was talking with Gehazi the servant of the man of God, saying, &#x201C;Please tell me all the great things that Elisha has done.&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#xA0;</span>As he was telling the king how he had restored to life him who was dead, behold, the woman whose son he had restored to life begged the king for her house and for her land.
