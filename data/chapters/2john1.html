This is the commandment, even as you heard from the beginning, that you should walk in it. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#xA0;</span>For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who don&#x2019;t confess that Jesus Christ came in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the Antichrist.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#xA0;</span>Watch yourselves, that we don&#x2019;t lose the things which we have accomplished, but that we receive a full reward.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#xA0;</span>Whoever transgresses and doesn&#x2019;t remain in the teaching of Christ doesn&#x2019;t have God. He who remains in the teaching has both the Father and the Son.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#xA0;</span>If anyone comes to you and doesn&#x2019;t bring this teaching, don&#x2019;t receive him into your house, and don&#x2019;t welcome him,  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#xA0;</span>for he who welcomes him participates in his evil deeds. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#xA0;</span>Having many things to write to you, I don&#x2019;t want to do so with paper and ink, but I hope to come to you and to speak face to face, that our joy may be made full.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#xA0;</span>The children of your chosen sister greet you. Amen. </div>
