I took it.&#x201D; </div><div class="p">His mother said, &#x201C;May the LORD bless my son!&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#xA0;</span>He restored the eleven hundred pieces of silver to his mother, then his mother said, &#x201C;I most certainly dedicate the silver to the LORD from my hand for my son, to make a carved image and a molten image. Now therefore I will restore it to you.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#xA0;</span>When he restored the money to his mother, his mother took two hundred pieces of silver, and gave them to a silversmith, who made a carved image and a molten image out of it. It was in the house of Micah. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#xA0;</span>The man Micah had a house of gods, and he made an ephod, and teraphim,<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> teraphim were household idols that may have been associated with inheritance rights to the household property.</span></a> and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#xA0;</span>In those days there was no king in Israel. Everyone did that which was right in his own eyes.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#xA0;</span>There was a young man out of Bethlehem Judah, of the family of Judah, who was a Levite; and he lived there.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#xA0;</span>The man departed out of the city, out of Bethlehem Judah, to live where he could find a place, and he came to the hill country of Ephraim, to the house of Micah, as he travelled.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#xA0;</span>Micah said to him, &#x201C;Where did you come from?&#x201D; </div><div class="p">He said to him, &#x201C;I am a Levite of Bethlehem Judah, and I am looking for a place to live.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#xA0;</span>Micah said to him, &#x201C;Dwell with me, and be to me a father and a priest, and I will give you ten pieces of silver per year, a suit of clothing, and your food.&#x201D; So the Levite went in.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#xA0;</span>The Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young man was to him as one of his sons.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#xA0;</span>Micah consecrated the Levite, and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Micah.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#xA0;</span>Then Micah said, &#x201C;Now I know that the LORD will do good to me, since I have a Levite as my priest.&#x201D; </div>
