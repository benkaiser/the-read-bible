He called that place Perez Uzza, to this day.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#xA0;</span>David was afraid of God that day, saying, &#x201C;How can I bring God&#x2019;s ark home to me?&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#xA0;</span>So David didn&#x2019;t move the ark with him into David&#x2019;s city, but carried it aside into Obed-Edom the Gittite&#x2019;s house.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#xA0;</span>God&#x2019;s ark remained with the family of Obed-Edom in his house three months; and the LORD blessed Obed-Edom&#x2019;s house and all that he had. </div>
