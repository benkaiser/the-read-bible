Behold, if it is true, and the thing certain, that such abomination is done in Israel,  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#xA0;</span>then you shall bring out that man or that woman who has done this evil thing to your gates, even that same man or woman; and you shall stone them to death with stones.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#xA0;</span>At the mouth of two witnesses, or three witnesses, he who is to die shall be put to death. At the mouth of one witness he shall not be put to death.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#xA0;</span>The hands of the witnesses shall be first on him to put him to death, and afterward the hands of all the people.
