So where do you get that living water?  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#xA0;</span>Are you greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well and drank from it himself, as did his children and his livestock?&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#xA0;</span>Jesus answered her, <span class="wj">&#x201C;Everyone who drinks of this water will thirst again, </span>  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#xA0;</span> <span class="wj">but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him will never thirst again; but the water that I will give him will become in him a well of water springing up to eternal life.&#x201D;</span> </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#xA0;</span>The woman said to him, &#x201C;Sir, give me this water, so that I don&#x2019;t get thirsty, neither come all the way here to draw.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#xA0;</span>Jesus said to her, <span class="wj">&#x201C;Go, call your husband, and come here.&#x201D; </span> </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#xA0;</span>The woman answered, &#x201C;I have no husband.&#x201D; </div><div class="p">Jesus said to her, <span class="wj">&#x201C;You said well, &#x2018;I have no husband,&#x2019; </span>  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#xA0;</span> <span class="wj">for you have had five husbands; and he whom you now have is not your husband. This you have said truly.&#x201D;</span> </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#xA0;</span>The woman said to him, &#x201C;Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#xA0;</span>Our fathers worshipped in this mountain, and you Jews say that in Jerusalem is the place where people ought to worship.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#xA0;</span>Jesus said to her, <span class="wj">&#x201C;Woman, believe me, the hour is coming when neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#xA0;</span> <span class="wj">You worship that which you don&#x2019;t know. We worship that which we know; for salvation is from the Jews. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#xA0;</span> <span class="wj">But the hour comes, and now is, when the true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father seeks such to be his worshippers. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#xA0;</span> <span class="wj">God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.&#x201D;</span> </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#xA0;</span>The woman said to him, &#x201C;I know that Messiah is coming, he who is called Christ.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">&#x2020;<span class="popup"> &#x201C;Messiah&#x201D; (Hebrew) and &#x201C;Christ&#x201D; (Greek) both mean &#x201C;Anointed One&#x201D;.</span></a> When he has come, he will declare to us all things.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#xA0;</span>Jesus said to her, <span class="wj">&#x201C;I am he, the one who speaks to you.&#x201D;</span> </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#xA0;</span>Just then, his disciples came.

Can this be the Christ?&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#xA0;</span>They went out of the city, and were coming to him. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#xA0;</span>In the meanwhile, the disciples urged him, saying, &#x201C;Rabbi, eat.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#xA0;</span>But he said to them, <span class="wj">&#x201C;I have food to eat that you don&#x2019;t know about.&#x201D;</span> </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#xA0;</span>The disciples therefore said to one another, &#x201C;Has anyone brought him something to eat?&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#xA0;</span>Jesus said to them, <span class="wj">&#x201C;My food is to do the will of him who sent me and to accomplish his work. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#xA0;</span> <span class="wj">Don&#x2019;t you say, &#x2018;There are yet four months until the harvest?&#x2019; Behold, I tell you, lift up your eyes and look at the fields, that they are white for harvest already. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#xA0;</span> <span class="wj">He who reaps receives wages and gathers fruit to eternal life, that both he who sows and he who reaps may rejoice together. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#xA0;</span> <span class="wj">For in this the saying is true, &#x2018;One sows, and another reaps.&#x2019; </span>  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#xA0;</span> <span class="wj">I sent you to reap that for which you haven&#x2019;t laboured.

He stayed there two days.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#xA0;</span>Many more believed because of his word.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#xA0;</span>They said to the woman, &#x201C;Now we believe, not because of your speaking; for we have heard for ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#xA0;</span>After the two days he went out from there and went into Galilee.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#xA0;</span>For Jesus himself testified that a prophet has no honour in his own country.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#xA0;</span>So when he came into Galilee, the Galileans received him, having seen all the things that he did in Jerusalem at the feast, for they also went to the feast.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#xA0;</span>Jesus came therefore again to Cana of Galilee, where he made the water into wine. There was a certain nobleman whose son was sick at Capernaum.  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#xA0;</span>When he heard that Jesus had come out of Judea into Galilee, he went to him and begged him that he would come down and heal his son, for he was at the point of death.  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#xA0;</span>Jesus therefore said to him, <span class="wj">&#x201C;Unless you see signs and wonders, you will in no way believe.&#x201D;</span> </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#xA0;</span>The nobleman said to him, &#x201C;Sir, come down before my child dies.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#xA0;</span>Jesus said to him, <span class="wj">&#x201C;Go your way. Your son lives.&#x201D;</span> The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him, and he went his way.  <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#xA0;</span>As he was going down, his servants met him and reported, saying &#x201C;Your child lives!&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#xA0;</span>So he enquired of them the hour when he began to get better. They said therefore to him, &#x201C;Yesterday at the seventh hour,<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">&#x2021;<span class="popup"> 1:00 p.m.</span></a> the fever left him.&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V53">53&#xA0;</span>So the father knew that it was at that hour in which Jesus said to him, <span class="wj">&#x201C;Your son lives.&#x201D;</span> He believed, as did his whole house.  <span class="verse" id="V54">54&#xA0;</span>This is again the second sign that Jesus did, having come out of Judea into Galilee. </div>
