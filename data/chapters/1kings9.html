I have made this house holy, which you have built, to put my name there forever; and my eyes and my heart shall be there perpetually.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#xA0;</span>As for you, if you will walk before me as David your father walked, in integrity of heart and in uprightness, to do according to all that I have commanded you, and will keep my statutes and my ordinances,  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#xA0;</span>then I will establish the throne of your kingdom over Israel forever, as I promised to David your father, saying, &#x2018;There shall not fail from you a man on the throne of Israel.&#x2019;  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#xA0;</span>But if you turn away from following me, you or your children, and not keep my commandments and my statutes which I have set before you, but go and serve other gods and worship them,  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#xA0;</span>then I will cut off Israel out of the land which I have given them; and I will cast this house, which I have made holy for my name, out of my sight; and Israel will be a proverb and a byword amongst all peoples.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#xA0;</span>Though this house is so high, yet everyone who passes by it will be astonished and hiss; and they will say, &#x2018;Why has the LORD done this to this land and to this house?&#x2019;  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#xA0;</span>and they will answer, &#x2018;Because they abandoned the LORD their God, who brought their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and embraced other gods, and worshipped them, and served them.
