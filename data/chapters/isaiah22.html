They were bound by the archers. All who were found by you were bound together. They fled far away.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#xA0;</span>Therefore I said, &#x201C;Look away from me. I will weep bitterly. Don&#x2019;t labour to comfort me for the destruction of the daughter of my people. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#xA0;</span>For it is a day of confusion, and of treading down, and of perplexity from the Lord, the LORD of Armies, in the valley of vision, a breaking down of the walls, and a crying to the mountains.&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#xA0;</span>Elam carried his quiver, with chariots of men and horsemen; and Kir uncovered the shield.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#xA0;</span>Your choicest valleys were full of chariots, and the horsemen set themselves in array at the gate.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#xA0;</span>He took away the covering of Judah; and you looked in that day to the armour in the house of the forest.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#xA0;</span>You saw the breaches of David&#x2019;s city, that they were many; and you gathered together the waters of the lower pool.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#xA0;</span>You counted the houses of Jerusalem, and you broke down the houses to fortify the wall.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#xA0;</span>You also made a reservoir between the two walls for the water of the old pool. But you didn&#x2019;t look to him who had done this, neither did you have respect for him who planned it long ago. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#xA0;</span>In that day, the Lord, the LORD of Armies, called to weeping, to mourning, to baldness, and to dressing in sackcloth;  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#xA0;</span>and behold, there is joy and gladness, killing cattle and killing sheep, eating meat and drinking wine: &#x201C;Let&#x2019;s eat and drink, for tomorrow we will die.&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#xA0;</span>The LORD of Armies revealed himself in my ears, &#x201C;Surely this iniquity will not be forgiven you until you die,&#x201D; says the Lord, the LORD of Armies. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#xA0;</span>The Lord, the LORD of Armies says, &#x201C;Go, get yourself to this treasurer, even to Shebna, who is over the house, and say,  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#xA0;</span>&#x2018;What are you doing here? Who has you here, that you have dug out a tomb here?&#x2019; Cutting himself out a tomb on high, chiselling a habitation for himself in the rock!&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#xA0;</span>Behold, the LORD will overcome you and hurl you away violently. Yes, he will grasp you firmly.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#xA0;</span>He will surely wind you around and around, and throw you like a ball into a large country. There you will die, and there the chariots of your glory will be, you disgrace of your lord&#x2019;s house.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#xA0;</span>I will thrust you from your office. You will be pulled down from your station. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#xA0;</span>It will happen in that day that I will call my servant Eliakim the son of Hilkiah,  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#xA0;</span>and I will clothe him with your robe, and strengthen him with your belt. I will commit your government into his hand; and he will be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to the house of Judah.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#xA0;</span>I will lay the key of David&#x2019;s house on his shoulder. He will open, and no one will shut. He will shut, and no one will open.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#xA0;</span>I will fasten him like a nail in a sure place. He will be for a throne of glory to his father&#x2019;s house.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#xA0;</span>They will hang on him all the glory of his father&#x2019;s house, the offspring and the issue, every small vessel, from the cups even to all the pitchers.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#xA0;</span>&#x201C;In that day,&#x201D; says the LORD of Armies, &#x201C;the nail that was fastened in a sure place will give way.
