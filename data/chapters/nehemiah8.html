The ears of all the people were attentive to the book of the law.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#xA0;</span>Ezra the scribe stood on a pulpit of wood, which they had made for the purpose; and beside him stood Mattithiah, Shema, Anaiah, Uriah, Hilkiah, and Maaseiah, on his right hand; and on his left hand, Pedaiah, Mishael, Malchijah, Hashum, Hashbaddanah, Zechariah, and Meshullam.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#xA0;</span>Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people (for he was above all the people), and when he opened it, all the people stood up.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#xA0;</span>Then Ezra blessed the LORD, the great God. </div><div class="p">All the people answered, &#x201C;Amen, Amen,&#x201D; with the lifting up of their hands.

Don&#x2019;t mourn, nor weep.&#x201D; For all the people wept when they heard the words of the law.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#xA0;</span>Then he said to them, &#x201C;Go your way. Eat the fat, drink the sweet, and send portions to him for whom nothing is prepared, for today is holy to our Lord. Don&#x2019;t be grieved, for the joy of the LORD is your strength.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#xA0;</span>So the Levites calmed all the people, saying, &#x201C;Hold your peace, for the day is holy.
