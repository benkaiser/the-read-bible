<div class="chapterlabel" id="V0"> 11</div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#xA0;</span>Be imitators of me, even as I also am of Christ. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#xA0;</span>Now I praise you, brothers, that you remember me in all things, and hold firm the traditions, even as I delivered them to you.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#xA0;</span>But I would have you know that the head<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> or, origin</span></a> of every man is Christ, and the head<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">&#x2020;<span class="popup"> or, origin</span></a> of the woman is man, and the head<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">&#x2021;<span class="popup"> or, origin</span></a> of Christ is God.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#xA0;</span>Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonours his head.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#xA0;</span>But every woman praying or prophesying with her head uncovered dishonours her head. For it is one and the same thing as if she were shaved.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#xA0;</span>For if a woman is not covered, let her hair also be cut off. But if it is shameful for a woman to have her hair cut off or be shaved, let her be covered.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#xA0;</span>For a man indeed ought not to have his head covered, because he is the image and glory of God, but the woman is the glory of the man.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#xA0;</span>For man is not from woman, but woman from man;  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#xA0;</span>for man wasn&#x2019;t created for the woman, but woman for the man.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#xA0;</span>For this cause the woman ought to have authority over her own head, because of the angels. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#xA0;</span>Nevertheless, neither is the woman independent of the man, nor the man independent of the woman, in the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#xA0;</span>For as woman came from man, so a man also comes through a woman; but all things are from God.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#xA0;</span>Judge for yourselves. Is it appropriate that a woman pray to God unveiled?  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#xA0;</span>Doesn&#x2019;t even nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a dishonour to him?  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#xA0;</span>But if a woman has long hair, it is a glory to her, for her hair is given to her for a covering.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#xA0;</span>But if any man seems to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither do God&#x2019;s assemblies. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#xA0;</span>But in giving you this command I don&#x2019;t praise you, because you come together not for the better but for the worse.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#xA0;</span>For first of all, when you come together in the assembly, I hear that divisions exist amongst you, and I partly believe it.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#xA0;</span>For there also must be factions amongst you, that those who are approved may be revealed amongst you.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#xA0;</span>When therefore you assemble yourselves together, it is not the Lord&#x2019;s supper that you eat.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#xA0;</span>For in your eating each one takes his own supper first. One is hungry, and another is drunken.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#xA0;</span>What, don&#x2019;t you have houses to eat and to drink in? Or do you despise God&#x2019;s assembly and put them to shame who don&#x2019;t have enough? What shall I tell you? Shall I praise you? In this I don&#x2019;t praise you. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#xA0;</span>For I received from the Lord that which also I delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus on the night in which he was betrayed took bread.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#xA0;</span>When he had given thanks, he broke it and said, <span class="wj">&#x201C;Take, eat. This is my body, which is broken for you. Do this in memory of me.&#x201D;</span>  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#xA0;</span>In the same way he also took the cup after supper, saying, <span class="wj">&#x201C;This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink, in memory of me.&#x201D;</span>  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#xA0;</span>For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord&#x2019;s death until he comes. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#xA0;</span>Therefore whoever eats this bread or drinks the Lord&#x2019;s cup in a way unworthy of the Lord will be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#xA0;</span>But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of the bread and drink of the cup.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#xA0;</span>For he who eats and drinks in an unworthy way eats and drinks judgement to himself if he doesn&#x2019;t discern the Lord&#x2019;s body.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#xA0;</span>For this cause many amongst you are weak and sickly, and not a few sleep.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#xA0;</span>For if we discerned ourselves, we wouldn&#x2019;t be judged.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#xA0;</span>But when we are judged, we are disciplined by the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#xA0;</span>Therefore, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait for one another.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#xA0;</span>But if anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, lest your coming together be for judgement. The rest I will set in order whenever I come. </div>
