Then he requested for himself that he might die, and said, &#x201C;It is enough. Now, O LORD, take away my life; for I am not better than my fathers.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#xA0;</span>He lay down and slept under a juniper tree; and behold, an angel touched him, and said to him, &#x201C;Arise and eat!&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#xA0;</span>He looked, and behold, there was at his head a cake baked on the coals, and a jar of water.
