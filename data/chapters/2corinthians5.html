Or if we are of sober mind, it is for you.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#xA0;</span>For the love of Christ compels us; because we judge thus: that one died for all, therefore all died.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#xA0;</span>He died for all, that those who live should no longer live to themselves, but to him who for their sakes died and rose again. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#xA0;</span>Therefore we know no one according to the flesh from now on. Even though we have known Christ according to the flesh, yet now we know him so no more.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#xA0;</span>Therefore if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old things have passed away. Behold,<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> &#x201C;Behold&#x201D;, from &#x201C;&#x1F30;&#x3B4;&#x3BF;&#x1F7A;&#x201D;, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at. It is often used as an interjection.</span></a> all things have become new.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#xA0;</span>But all things are of God, who reconciled us to himself through Jesus Christ, and gave to us the ministry of reconciliation;  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#xA0;</span>namely, that God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself, not reckoning to them their trespasses, and having committed to us the word of reconciliation. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#xA0;</span>We are therefore ambassadors on behalf of Christ, as though God were entreating by us: we beg you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#xA0;</span>For him who knew no sin he made to be sin on our behalf, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God. </div>
