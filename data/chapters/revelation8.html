Much incense was given to him, that he should add it to the prayers of all the saints on the golden altar which was before the throne.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#xA0;</span>The smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, went up before God out of the angel&#x2019;s hand.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#xA0;</span>The angel took the censer, and he filled it with the fire of the altar, then threw it on the earth.
