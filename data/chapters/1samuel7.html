When the children of Israel heard it, they were afraid of the Philistines.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#xA0;</span>The children of Israel said to Samuel, &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t stop crying to the LORD our God for us, that he will save us out of the hand of the Philistines.&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#xA0;</span>Samuel took a suckling lamb, and offered it for a whole burnt offering to the LORD. Samuel cried to the LORD for Israel, and the LORD answered him.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#xA0;</span>As Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines came near to battle against Israel; but the LORD thundered with a great thunder on that day on the Philistines and confused them; and they were struck down before Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#xA0;</span>The men of Israel went out of Mizpah and pursued the Philistines, and struck them until they came under Beth Kar. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#xA0;</span>Then Samuel took a stone and set it between Mizpah and Shen, and called its name Ebenezer,<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> &#x201C;Ebenezer&#x201D; means &#x201C;stone of help&#x201D;.</span></a> saying, &#x201C;The LORD helped us until now.&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#xA0;</span>So the Philistines were subdued, and they stopped coming within the border of Israel.
