The children of Israel said, &#x201C;Tell us, how did this wickedness happen?&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#xA0;</span>The Levite, the husband of the woman who was murdered, answered, &#x201C;I came into Gibeah that belongs to Benjamin, I and my concubine, to spend the night.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#xA0;</span>The men of Gibeah rose against me, and surrounded the house by night. They intended to kill me and they raped my concubine, and she is dead.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#xA0;</span>I took my concubine and cut her in pieces, and sent her throughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel; for they have committed lewdness and folly in Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#xA0;</span>Behold, you children of Israel, all of you, give here your advice and counsel.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#xA0;</span>All the people arose as one man, saying, &#x201C;None of us will go to his tent, neither will any of us turn to his house.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#xA0;</span>But now this is the thing which we will do to Gibeah: we will go up against it by lot;  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#xA0;</span>and we will take ten men of one hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel, and one hundred of one thousand, and a thousand out of ten thousand to get food for the people, that they may do, when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin, according to all the folly that the men of Gibeah have done in Israel.&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#xA0;</span>So all the men of Israel were gathered against the city, knit together as one man. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#xA0;</span>The tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin, saying, &#x201C;What wickedness is this that has happened amongst you?  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#xA0;</span>Now therefore deliver up the men, the wicked fellows who are in Gibeah, that we may put them to death and put away evil from Israel.&#x201D; </div><div class="p">But Benjamin would not listen to the voice of their brothers, the children of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#xA0;</span>The children of Benjamin gathered themselves together out of the cities to Gibeah, to go out to battle against the children of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#xA0;</span>The children of Benjamin were counted on that day out of the cities twenty-six thousand men who drew the sword, in addition to the inhabitants of Gibeah, who were counted seven hundred chosen men.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#xA0;</span>Amongst all these soldiers there were seven hundred chosen men who were left-handed. Every one of them could sling a stone at a hair and not miss.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#xA0;</span>The men of Israel, besides Benjamin, were counted four hundred thousand men who drew sword. All these were men of war. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#xA0;</span>The children of Israel arose, went up to Bethel, and asked counsel of God.

Then the ambushers of Israel broke out of their place, even out of Maareh Geba.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#xA0;</span>Ten thousand chosen men out of all Israel came over against Gibeah, and the battle was severe; but they didn&#x2019;t know that disaster was close to them.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#xA0;</span>The LORD struck Benjamin before Israel; and the children of Israel destroyed of Benjamin that day twenty-five thousand and one hundred men. All these drew the sword.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#xA0;</span>So the children of Benjamin saw that they were struck, for the men of Israel yielded to Benjamin because they trusted the ambushers whom they had set against Gibeah.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#xA0;</span>The ambushers hurried, and rushed on Gibeah; then the ambushers spread out, and struck all the city with the edge of the sword.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#xA0;</span>Now the appointed sign between the men of Israel and the ambushers was that they should make a great cloud of smoke rise up out of the city.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#xA0;</span>The men of Israel turned in the battle, and Benjamin began to strike and kill of the men of Israel about thirty persons; for they said, &#x201C;Surely they are struck down before us, as in the first battle.&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#xA0;</span>But when the cloud began to arise up out of the city in a pillar of smoke, the Benjamites looked behind them; and behold, the whole city went up in smoke to the sky.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#xA0;</span>The men of Israel turned, and the men of Benjamin were dismayed; for they saw that disaster had come on them.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#xA0;</span>Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel to the way of the wilderness, but the battle followed hard after them; and those who came out of the cities destroyed them in the middle of it.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#xA0;</span>They surrounded the Benjamites, chased them, and trod them down at their resting place, as far as near Gibeah towards the sunrise.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#xA0;</span>Eighteen thousand men of Benjamin fell; all these were men of valour.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#xA0;</span>They turned and fled towards the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon. They gleaned five thousand men of them in the highways, and followed hard after them to Gidom, and struck two thousand men of them.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#xA0;</span>So that all who fell that day of Benjamin were twenty-five thousand men who drew the sword. All these were men of valour.  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#xA0;</span>But six hundred men turned and fled towards the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon, and stayed in the rock of Rimmon four months.  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#xA0;</span>The men of Israel turned again on the children of Benjamin, and struck them with the edge of the sword&#x2014;including the entire city, the livestock, and all that they found. Moreover they set all the cities which they found on fire. </div>
