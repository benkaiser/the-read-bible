For he is greater who prophesies than he who speaks with other languages, unless he interprets, that the assembly may be built up. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#xA0;</span>But now, brothers,<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> The word for &#x201C;brothers&#x201D; here and where context allows may also be correctly translated &#x201C;brothers and sisters&#x201D; or &#x201C;siblings.&#x201D; </span></a> if I come to you speaking with other languages, what would I profit you unless I speak to you either by way of revelation, or of knowledge, or of prophesying, or of teaching?  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#xA0;</span>Even lifeless things that make a sound, whether pipe or harp, if they didn&#x2019;t give a distinction in the sounds, how would it be known what is piped or harped?  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#xA0;</span>For if the trumpet gave an uncertain sound, who would prepare himself for war?  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#xA0;</span>So also you, unless you uttered by the tongue words easy to understand, how would it be known what is spoken? For you would be speaking into the air.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#xA0;</span>There are, it may be, so many kinds of languages in the world, and none of them is without meaning.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#xA0;</span>If then I don&#x2019;t know the meaning of the language, I would be to him who speaks a foreigner, and he who speaks would be a foreigner to me.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#xA0;</span>So also you, since you are zealous for spiritual gifts, seek that you may abound to the building up of the assembly. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#xA0;</span>Therefore let him who speaks in another language pray that he may interpret.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#xA0;</span>For if I pray in another language, my spirit prays, but my understanding is unfruitful. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#xA0;</span>What should I do? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also. I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#xA0;</span>Otherwise, if you bless with the spirit, how will he who fills the place of the unlearned say the &#x201C;Amen&#x201D; at your giving of thanks, seeing he doesn&#x2019;t know what you say?  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#xA0;</span>For you most certainly give thanks well, but the other person is not built up.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#xA0;</span>I thank my God, I speak with other languages more than you all.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#xA0;</span>However, in the assembly I would rather speak five words with my understanding, that I might instruct others also, than ten thousand words in another language. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#xA0;</span>Brothers, don&#x2019;t be children in thoughts, yet in malice be babies, but in thoughts be mature.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#xA0;</span>In the law it is written, &#x201C;By men of strange languages and by the lips of strangers I will speak to this people. They won&#x2019;t even listen to me that way, says the Lord.&#x201D;<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">&#x2721;<span class="popup"> Isaiah 28:11-12</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#xA0;</span>Therefore other languages are for a sign, not to those who believe, but to the unbelieving; but prophesying is for a sign, not to the unbelieving, but to those who believe.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#xA0;</span>If therefore the whole assembly is assembled together and all speak with other languages, and unlearned or unbelieving people come in, won&#x2019;t they say that you are crazy?  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#xA0;</span>But if all prophesy, and someone unbelieving or unlearned comes in, he is reproved by all, and he is judged by all.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#xA0;</span>And thus the secrets of his heart are revealed. So he will fall down on his face and worship God, declaring that God is amongst you indeed. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#xA0;</span>What is it then, brothers? When you come together, each one of you has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has another language, or has an interpretation. Let all things be done to build each other up.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#xA0;</span>If any man speaks in another language, let there be two, or at the most three, and in turn; and let one interpret.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#xA0;</span>But if there is no interpreter, let him keep silent in the assembly, and let him speak to himself and to God.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#xA0;</span>Let two or three of the prophets speak, and let the others discern.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#xA0;</span>But if a revelation is made to another sitting by, let the first keep silent.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#xA0;</span>For you all can prophesy one by one, that all may learn and all may be exhorted.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#xA0;</span>The spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets,  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#xA0;</span>for God is not a God of confusion but of peace, as in all the assemblies of the saints.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#xA0;</span>Let the wives be quiet in the assemblies, for it has not been permitted for them to be talking except in submission, as the law also says,<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">&#x2721;<span class="popup"> Deuteronomy 27:9</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#xA0;</span>if they desire to learn anything. &#x201C;Let them ask their own husbands at home, for it is shameful for a wife to be talking in the assembly.&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#xA0;</span>What!? Was it from you that the word of God went out? Or did it come to you alone? </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#xA0;</span>If any man thinks himself to be a prophet or spiritual, let him recognise the things which I write to you, that they are the commandment of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#xA0;</span>But if anyone is ignorant, let him be ignorant. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#xA0;</span>Therefore, brothers, desire earnestly to prophesy, and don&#x2019;t forbid speaking with other languages.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#xA0;</span>Let all things be done decently and in order. </div>
