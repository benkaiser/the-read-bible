There was not a man to till the ground,  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#xA0;</span>but a mist went up from the earth, and watered the whole surface of the ground.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#xA0;</span>The LORD God formed man from the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#xA0;</span>The LORD God planted a garden eastward, in Eden, and there he put the man whom he had formed.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#xA0;</span>Out of the ground the LORD God made every tree to grow that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food, including the tree of life in the middle of the garden and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#xA0;</span>A river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from there it was parted, and became the source of four rivers.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#xA0;</span>The name of the first is Pishon: it flows through the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#xA0;</span>and the gold of that land is good.

The fourth river is the Euphrates.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#xA0;</span>The LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to cultivate and keep it.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#xA0;</span>The LORD God commanded the man, saying, &#x201C;You may freely eat of every tree of the garden;  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#xA0;</span>but you shall not eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil; for in the day that you eat of it, you will surely die.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#xA0;</span>The LORD God said, &#x201C;It is not good for the man to be alone.
