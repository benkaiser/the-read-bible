Do you desire to have no fear of the authority? Do that which is good, and you will have praise from the authority,  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#xA0;</span>for he is a servant of God to you for good. But if you do that which is evil, be afraid, for he doesn&#x2019;t bear the sword in vain; for he is a servant of God, an avenger for wrath to him who does evil.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#xA0;</span>Therefore you need to be in subjection, not only because of the wrath, but also for conscience&#x2019; sake.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#xA0;</span>For this reason you also pay taxes, for they are servants of God&#x2019;s service, continually doing this very thing.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#xA0;</span>Therefore give everyone what you owe: if you owe taxes, pay taxes; if customs, then customs; if respect, then respect; if honour, then honour. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#xA0;</span>Owe no one anything, except to love one another; for he who loves his neighbour has fulfilled the law.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#xA0;</span>For the commandments, &#x201C;You shall not commit adultery,&#x201D; &#x201C;You shall not murder,&#x201D; &#x201C;You shall not steal,&#x201D;<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> TR adds &#x201C;You shall not give false testimony,&#x201D;</span></a> &#x201C;You shall not covet,&#x201D; <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">&#x2721;<span class="popup"> Exodus 20:13-15,17; Deuteronomy 5:17-19,21</span></a> and whatever other commandments there are, are all summed up in this saying, namely, &#x201C;You shall love your neighbour as yourself.&#x201D;<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">&#x2721;<span class="popup"> Leviticus 19:18</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#xA0;</span>Love doesn&#x2019;t harm a neighbour.
