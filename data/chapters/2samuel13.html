<div class="chapterlabel" id="V0"> 13</div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#xA0;</span>After this, Absalom the son of David had a beautiful sister, whose name was Tamar; and Amnon the son of David loved her.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#xA0;</span>Amnon was so troubled that he became sick because of his sister Tamar, for she was a virgin, and it seemed hard to Amnon to do anything to her.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#xA0;</span>But Amnon had a friend whose name was Jonadab the son of Shimeah, David&#x2019;s brother; and Jonadab was a very subtle man.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#xA0;</span>He said to him, &#x201C;Why, son of the king, are you so sad from day to day? Won&#x2019;t you tell me?&#x201D; </div><div class="p">Amnon said to him, &#x201C;I love Tamar, my brother Absalom&#x2019;s sister.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#xA0;</span>Jonadab said to him, &#x201C;Lay down on your bed and pretend to be sick. When your father comes to see you, tell him, &#x2018;Please let my sister Tamar come and give me bread to eat, and prepare the food in my sight, that I may see it and eat it from her hand.&#x2019;&#xA0;&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#xA0;</span>So Amnon lay down and faked being sick. When the king came to see him, Amnon said to the king, &#x201C;Please let my sister Tamar come and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat from her hand.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#xA0;</span>Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, &#x201C;Go now to your brother Amnon&#x2019;s house, and prepare food for him.&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#xA0;</span>So Tamar went to her brother Amnon&#x2019;s house; and he was lying down. She took dough, kneaded it, made cakes in his sight, and baked the cakes.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#xA0;</span>She took the pan and poured them out before him, but he refused to eat. Amnon said, &#x201C;Have all men leave me.&#x201D; Then every man went out from him.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#xA0;</span>Amnon said to Tamar, &#x201C;Bring the food into the room, that I may eat from your hand.&#x201D; Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought them into the room to Amnon her brother.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#xA0;</span>When she had brought them near to him to eat, he took hold of her and said to her, &#x201C;Come, lie with me, my sister!&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#xA0;</span>She answered him, &#x201C;No, my brother, do not force me! For no such thing ought to be done in Israel. Don&#x2019;t you do this folly!  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#xA0;</span>As for me, where would I carry my shame? And as for you, you will be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, please speak to the king; for he will not withhold me from you.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#xA0;</span>However, he would not listen to her voice; but being stronger than she, he forced her and lay with her.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#xA0;</span>Then Amnon hated her with exceedingly great hatred; for the hatred with which he hated her was greater than the love with which he had loved her. Amnon said to her, &#x201C;Arise, be gone!&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#xA0;</span>She said to him, &#x201C;Not so, because this great wrong in sending me away is worse than the other that you did to me!&#x201D; </div><div class="p">But he would not listen to her.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#xA0;</span>Then he called his servant who ministered to him, and said, &#x201C;Now put this woman out from me, and bolt the door after her.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#xA0;</span>She had a garment of various colours on her, for the king&#x2019;s daughters who were virgins dressed in such robes. Then his servant brought her out and bolted the door after her.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#xA0;</span>Tamar put ashes on her head, and tore her garment of various colours that was on her; and she laid her hand on her head and went her way, crying aloud as she went.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#xA0;</span>Absalom her brother said to her, &#x201C;Has Amnon your brother been with you? But now hold your peace, my sister. He is your brother. Don&#x2019;t take this thing to heart.&#x201D; </div><div class="p">So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom&#x2019;s house.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#xA0;</span>But when King David heard of all these things, he was very angry.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#xA0;</span>Absalom spoke to Amnon neither good nor bad; for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#xA0;</span>After two full years, Absalom had sheep shearers in Baal Hazor, which is beside Ephraim; and Absalom invited all the king&#x2019;s sons.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#xA0;</span>Absalom came to the king and said, &#x201C;See now, your servant has sheep shearers. Please let the king and his servants go with your servant.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#xA0;</span>The king said to Absalom, &#x201C;No, my son, let&#x2019;s not all go, lest we be burdensome to you.&#x201D; He pressed him; however he would not go, but blessed him. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#xA0;</span>Then Absalom said, &#x201C;If not, please let my brother Amnon go with us.&#x201D; </div><div class="p">The king said to him, &#x201C;Why should he go with you?&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#xA0;</span>But Absalom pressed him, and he let Amnon and all the king&#x2019;s sons go with him.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#xA0;</span>Absalom commanded his servants, saying, &#x201C;Mark now, when Amnon&#x2019;s heart is merry with wine; and when I tell you, &#x2018;Strike Amnon,&#x2019; then kill him. Don&#x2019;t be afraid. Haven&#x2019;t I commanded you? Be courageous, and be valiant!&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#xA0;</span>The servants of Absalom did to Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king&#x2019;s sons arose, and every man got up on his mule and fled. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#xA0;</span>While they were on the way, the news came to David, saying, &#x201C;Absalom has slain all the king&#x2019;s sons, and there is not one of them left!&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#xA0;</span>Then the king arose, and tore his garments, and lay on the earth; and all his servants stood by with their clothes torn.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#xA0;</span>Jonadab the son of Shimeah, David&#x2019;s brother, answered, &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t let my lord suppose that they have killed all the young men, the king&#x2019;s sons, for Amnon only is dead; for by the appointment of Absalom this has been determined from the day that he forced his sister Tamar.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#xA0;</span>Now therefore don&#x2019;t let my lord the king take the thing to his heart, to think that all the king&#x2019;s sons are dead; for only Amnon is dead.&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#xA0;</span>But Absalom fled. The young man who kept the watch lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, many people were coming by way of the hillside behind him.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#xA0;</span>Jonadab said to the king, &#x201C;Behold, the king&#x2019;s sons are coming! It is as your servant said.&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#xA0;</span>As soon as he had finished speaking, behold, the king&#x2019;s sons came, and lifted up their voices and wept. The king also and all his servants wept bitterly. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#xA0;</span>But Absalom fled and went to Talmai the son of Ammihur, king of Geshur. David mourned for his son every day.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#xA0;</span>So Absalom fled and went to Geshur, and was there three years.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#xA0;</span>King David longed to go out to Absalom, for he was comforted concerning Amnon, since he was dead. </div>
