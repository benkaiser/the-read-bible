Indeed, you aren&#x2019;t ready even now,  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#xA0;</span>for you are still fleshly. For insofar as there is jealousy, strife, and factions amongst you, aren&#x2019;t you fleshly, and don&#x2019;t you walk in the ways of men?  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#xA0;</span>For when one says, &#x201C;I follow Paul,&#x201D; and another, &#x201C;I follow Apollos,&#x201D; aren&#x2019;t you fleshly? </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#xA0;</span>Who then is Apollos, and who is Paul, but servants through whom you believed, and each as the Lord gave to him?  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#xA0;</span>I planted. Apollos watered. But God gave the increase.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#xA0;</span>So then neither he who plants is anything, nor he who waters, but God who gives the increase.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#xA0;</span>Now he who plants and he who waters are the same, but each will receive his own reward according to his own labour.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#xA0;</span>For we are God&#x2019;s fellow workers. You are God&#x2019;s farming, God&#x2019;s building. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#xA0;</span>According to the grace of God which was given to me, as a wise master builder I laid a foundation, and another builds on it. But let each man be careful how he builds on it.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#xA0;</span>For no one can lay any other foundation than that which has been laid, which is Jesus Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#xA0;</span>But if anyone builds on the foundation with gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, or straw,  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#xA0;</span>each man&#x2019;s work will be revealed. For the Day will declare it, because it is revealed in fire; and the fire itself will test what sort of work each man&#x2019;s work is.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#xA0;</span>If any man&#x2019;s work remains which he built on it, he will receive a reward.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#xA0;</span>If any man&#x2019;s work is burnt, he will suffer loss, but he himself will be saved, but as through fire. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#xA0;</span>Don&#x2019;t you know that you are God&#x2019;s temple and that God&#x2019;s Spirit lives in you?  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#xA0;</span>If anyone destroys God&#x2019;s temple, God will destroy him; for God&#x2019;s temple is holy, which you are. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#xA0;</span>Let no one deceive himself. If anyone thinks that he is wise amongst you in this world, let him become a fool that he may become wise.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#xA0;</span>For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, &#x201C;He has taken the wise in their craftiness.&#x201D;<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">&#x2721;<span class="popup"> Job 5:13</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#xA0;</span>And again, &#x201C;The Lord knows the reasoning of the wise, that it is worthless.&#x201D;<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">&#x2721;<span class="popup"> Psalm 94:11</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#xA0;</span>Therefore let no one boast in men. For all things are yours,  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#xA0;</span>whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come. All are yours,  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#xA0;</span>and you are Christ&#x2019;s, and Christ is God&#x2019;s. </div>
