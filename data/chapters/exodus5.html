I don&#x2019;t know the LORD, and moreover I will not let Israel go.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#xA0;</span>They said, &#x201C;The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Please let us go three days&#x2019; journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to the LORD, our God, lest he fall on us with pestilence, or with the sword.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#xA0;</span>The king of Egypt said to them, &#x201C;Why do you, Moses and Aaron, take the people from their work? Get back to your burdens!&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#xA0;</span>Pharaoh said, &#x201C;Behold, the people of the land are now many, and you make them rest from their burdens.&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#xA0;</span>The same day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people and their officers, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#xA0;</span>&#x201C;You shall no longer give the people straw to make brick, as before. Let them go and gather straw for themselves.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#xA0;</span>You shall require from them the number of the bricks which they made before. You shall not diminish anything of it, for they are idle. Therefore they cry, saying, &#x2018;Let&#x2019;s go and sacrifice to our God.&#x2019;  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#xA0;</span>Let heavier work be laid on the men, that they may labour in it.
