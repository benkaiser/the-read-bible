Though it takes time, wait for it, because it will surely come. It won&#x2019;t delay.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#xA0;</span>Behold, his soul is puffed up. It is not upright in him, but the righteous will live by his faith.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#xA0;</span>Yes, moreover, wine is treacherous: an arrogant man who doesn&#x2019;t stay at home, who enlarges his desire as Sheol;<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Sheol is the place of the dead. </span></a> he is like death and can&#x2019;t be satisfied, but gathers to himself all nations and heaps to himself all peoples. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#xA0;</span>Won&#x2019;t all these take up a parable against him, and a taunting proverb against him, and say, &#x2018;Woe to him who increases that which is not his, and who enriches himself by extortion!
