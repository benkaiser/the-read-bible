Nevertheless, the journey that you take won&#x2019;t be for your honour; for the LORD will sell Sisera into a woman&#x2019;s hand.&#x201D; Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#xA0;</span>Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali together to Kedesh. Ten thousand men followed him; and Deborah went up with him.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#xA0;</span>Now Heber the Kenite had separated himself from the Kenites, even from the children of Hobab, Moses&#x2019; brother-in-law, and had pitched his tent as far as the oak in Zaanannim, which is by Kedesh.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#xA0;</span>They told Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam had gone up to Mount Tabor.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#xA0;</span>Sisera gathered together all his chariots, even nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people who were with him, from Harosheth of the Gentiles, to the river Kishon. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#xA0;</span>Deborah said to Barak, &#x201C;Go; for this is the day in which the LORD has delivered Sisera into your hand. Hasn&#x2019;t the LORD gone out before you?&#x201D; So Barak went down from Mount Tabor, and ten thousand men after him.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#xA0;</span>The LORD confused Sisera, all his chariots, and all his army, with the edge of the sword before Barak. Sisera abandoned his chariot and fled away on his feet.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#xA0;</span>But Barak pursued the chariots and the army to Harosheth of the Gentiles; and all the army of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword. There was not a man left. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#xA0;</span>However Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite; for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#xA0;</span>Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said to him, &#x201C;Turn in, my lord, turn in to me; don&#x2019;t be afraid.&#x201D; He came in to her into the tent, and she covered him with a rug. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#xA0;</span>He said to her, &#x201C;Please give me a little water to drink; for I am thirsty.&#x201D; </div><div class="p">She opened a container of milk, and gave him a drink, and covered him. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#xA0;</span>He said to her, &#x201C;Stand in the door of the tent, and if any man comes and enquires of you, and says, &#x2018;Is there any man here?&#x2019; you shall say, &#x2018;No.&#x2019;&#xA0;&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#xA0;</span>Then Jael, Heber&#x2019;s wife, took a tent peg, and took a hammer in her hand, and went softly to him, and struck the pin into his temples, and it pierced through into the ground, for he was in a deep sleep; so he fainted and died.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#xA0;</span>Behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him, and said to him, &#x201C;Come, and I will show you the man whom you seek.&#x201D; He came to her; and behold, Sisera lay dead, and the tent peg was in his temples.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#xA0;</span>So God subdued Jabin the king of Canaan before the children of Israel on that day.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#xA0;</span>The hand of the children of Israel prevailed more and more against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan. </div>
