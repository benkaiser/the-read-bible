He lived as a foreigner in Gerar.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#xA0;</span>Abraham said about Sarah his wife, &#x201C;She is my sister.&#x201D; Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#xA0;</span>But God came to Abimelech in a dream of the night, and said to him, &#x201C;Behold, you are a dead man, because of the woman whom you have taken; for she is a man&#x2019;s wife.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#xA0;</span>Now Abimelech had not come near her. He said, &#x201C;Lord, will you kill even a righteous nation?  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#xA0;</span>Didn&#x2019;t he tell me, &#x2018;She is my sister&#x2019;? She, even she herself, said, &#x2018;He is my brother.&#x2019; I have done this in the integrity of my heart and the innocence of my hands.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#xA0;</span>God said to him in the dream, &#x201C;Yes, I know that in the integrity of your heart you have done this, and I also withheld you from sinning against me. Therefore I didn&#x2019;t allow you to touch her.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#xA0;</span>Now therefore, restore the man&#x2019;s wife. For he is a prophet, and he will pray for you, and you will live. If you don&#x2019;t restore her, know for sure that you will die, you, and all who are yours.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#xA0;</span>Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ear. The men were very scared.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#xA0;</span>Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said to him, &#x201C;What have you done to us? How have I sinned against you, that you have brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? You have done deeds to me that ought not to be done!&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#xA0;</span>Abimelech said to Abraham, &#x201C;What did you see, that you have done this thing?&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#xA0;</span>Abraham said, &#x201C;Because I thought, &#x2018;Surely the fear of God is not in this place. They will kill me for my wife&#x2019;s sake.&#x2019;  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#xA0;</span>Besides, she is indeed my sister, the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#xA0;</span>When God caused me to wander from my father&#x2019;s house, I said to her, &#x2018;This is your kindness which you shall show to me. Everywhere that we go, say of me, &#x201C;He is my brother.&#x201D;&#xA0;&#x2019;&#xA0;&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#xA0;</span>Abimelech took sheep and cattle, male servants and female servants, and gave them to Abraham, and restored Sarah, his wife, to him.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#xA0;</span>Abimelech said, &#x201C;Behold, my land is before you. Dwell where it pleases you.&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#xA0;</span>To Sarah he said, &#x201C;Behold, I have given your brother a thousand pieces of silver. Behold, it is for you a covering of the eyes to all that are with you. In front of all you are vindicated.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#xA0;</span>Abraham prayed to God. So God healed Abimelech, his wife, and his female servants, and they bore children.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#xA0;</span>For the LORD had closed up tight all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah, Abraham&#x2019;s wife. </div>
