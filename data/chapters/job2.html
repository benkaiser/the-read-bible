For there is no one like him in the earth, a blameless and an upright man, one who fears God, and turns away from evil. He still maintains his integrity, although you incited me against him, to ruin him without cause.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#xA0;</span>Satan answered the LORD, and said, &#x201C;Skin for skin. Yes, all that a man has he will give for his life.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#xA0;</span>But stretch out your hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will renounce you to your face.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#xA0;</span>The LORD said to Satan, &#x201C;Behold, he is in your hand. Only spare his life.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#xA0;</span>So Satan went out from the presence of the LORD, and struck Job with painful sores from the sole of his foot to his head.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#xA0;</span>He took for himself a potsherd to scrape himself with, and he sat amongst the ashes.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#xA0;</span>Then his wife said to him, &#x201C;Do you still maintain your integrity? Renounce God, and die.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#xA0;</span>But he said to her, &#x201C;You speak as one of the foolish women would speak. What? Shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil?&#x201D; </div><div class="p">In all this Job didn&#x2019;t sin with his lips.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#xA0;</span>Now when Job&#x2019;s three friends heard of all this evil that had come on him, they each came from his own place: Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite; and they made an appointment together to come to sympathise with him and to comfort him.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#xA0;</span>When they lifted up their eyes from a distance, and didn&#x2019;t recognise him, they raised their voices, and wept; and they each tore his robe, and sprinkled dust on their heads towards the sky.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#xA0;</span>So they sat down with him on the ground seven days and seven nights, and no one spoke a word to him, for they saw that his grief was very great. </div>
