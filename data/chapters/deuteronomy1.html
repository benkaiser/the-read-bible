Our brothers have made our heart melt, saying, &#x2018;The people are greater and taller than we. The cities are great and fortified up to the sky.

Encourage him, for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#xA0;</span>Moreover your little ones, whom you said would be captured or killed, your children, who today have no knowledge of good or evil, shall go in there.
