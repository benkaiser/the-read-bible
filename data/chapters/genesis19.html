Lot saw them, and rose up to meet them. He bowed himself with his face to the earth,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#xA0;</span>and he said, &#x201C;See now, my lords, please come into your servant&#x2019;s house, stay all night, wash your feet, and you can rise up early, and go on your way.&#x201D; </div><div class="p">They said, &#x201C;No, but we will stay in the street all night.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#xA0;</span>He urged them greatly, and they came in with him, and entered into his house. He made them a feast, and baked unleavened bread, and they ate.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#xA0;</span>But before they lay down, the men of the city, the men of Sodom, surrounded the house, both young and old, all the people from every quarter.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#xA0;</span>They called to Lot, and said to him, &#x201C;Where are the men who came in to you this night? Bring them out to us, that we may have sex with them.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#xA0;</span>Lot went out to them through the door, and shut the door after himself.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#xA0;</span>He said, &#x201C;Please, my brothers, don&#x2019;t act so wickedly.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#xA0;</span>See now, I have two virgin daughters. Please let me bring them out to you, and you may do to them what seems good to you. Only don&#x2019;t do anything to these men, because they have come under the shadow of my roof.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#xA0;</span>They said, &#x201C;Stand back!&#x201D; Then they said, &#x201C;This one fellow came in to live as a foreigner, and he appoints himself a judge. Now we will deal worse with you than with them!&#x201D; They pressed hard on the man Lot, and came near to break the door.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#xA0;</span>But the men reached out their hand, and brought Lot into the house to them, and shut the door.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#xA0;</span>They struck the men who were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great, so that they wearied themselves to find the door. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#xA0;</span>The men said to Lot, &#x201C;Do you have anybody else here? Sons-in-law, your sons, your daughters, and whomever you have in the city, bring them out of the place:  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#xA0;</span>for we will destroy this place, because the outcry against them has grown so great before the LORD that the LORD has sent us to destroy it.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#xA0;</span>Lot went out, and spoke to his sons-in-law, who were pledged to marry his daughters, and said, &#x201C;Get up! Get out of this place, for the LORD will destroy the city!&#x201D; </div><div class="p">But he seemed to his sons-in-law to be joking.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#xA0;</span>When the morning came, then the angels hurried Lot, saying, &#x201C;Get up! Take your wife and your two daughters who are here, lest you be consumed in the iniquity of the city.&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#xA0;</span>But he lingered; and the men grabbed his hand, his wife&#x2019;s hand, and his two daughters&#x2019; hands, the LORD being merciful to him; and they took him out, and set him outside of the city.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#xA0;</span>It came to pass, when they had taken them out, that he said, &#x201C;Escape for your life! Don&#x2019;t look behind you, and don&#x2019;t stay anywhere in the plain. Escape to the mountains, lest you be consumed!&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#xA0;</span>Lot said to them, &#x201C;Oh, not so, my lord.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#xA0;</span>See now, your servant has found favour in your sight, and you have magnified your loving kindness, which you have shown to me in saving my life. I can&#x2019;t escape to the mountain, lest evil overtake me, and I die.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#xA0;</span>See now, this city is near to flee to, and it is a little one. Oh let me escape there (isn&#x2019;t it a little one?), and my soul will live.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#xA0;</span>He said to him, &#x201C;Behold, I have granted your request concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow the city of which you have spoken.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#xA0;</span>Hurry, escape there, for I can&#x2019;t do anything until you get there.&#x201D; Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Zoar means &#x201C;little&#x201D;.</span></a> </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#xA0;</span>The sun had risen on the earth when Lot came to Zoar.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#xA0;</span>Then the LORD rained on Sodom and on Gomorrah sulphur and fire from the LORD out of the sky.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#xA0;</span>He overthrew those cities, all the plain, all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew on the ground.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#xA0;</span>But Lot&#x2019;s wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#xA0;</span>Abraham went up early in the morning to the place where he had stood before the LORD.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#xA0;</span>He looked towards Sodom and Gomorrah, and towards all the land of the plain, and saw that the smoke of the land went up as the smoke of a furnace. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#xA0;</span>When God destroyed the cities of the plain, God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the middle of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in which Lot lived. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#xA0;</span>Lot went up out of Zoar, and lived in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he was afraid to live in Zoar. He lived in a cave with his two daughters.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#xA0;</span>The firstborn said to the younger, &#x201C;Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in to us in the way of all the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#xA0;</span>Come, let&#x2019;s make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve our father&#x2019;s family line.&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#xA0;</span>They made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father. He didn&#x2019;t know when she lay down, nor when she arose.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#xA0;</span>It came to pass on the next day, that the firstborn said to the younger, &#x201C;Behold, I lay last night with my father. Let&#x2019;s make him drink wine again tonight. You go in, and lie with him, that we may preserve our father&#x2019;s family line.&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#xA0;</span>They made their father drink wine that night also. The younger went and lay with him. He didn&#x2019;t know when she lay down, nor when she got up.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#xA0;</span>Thus both of Lot&#x2019;s daughters were with child by their father.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#xA0;</span>The firstborn bore a son, and named him Moab. He is the father of the Moabites to this day.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#xA0;</span>The younger also bore a son, and called his name Ben Ammi. He is the father of the children of Ammon to this day. </div>
