Part sided with the Jews and part with the apostles.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#xA0;</span>When some of both the Gentiles and the Jews, with their rulers, made a violent attempt to mistreat and stone them,  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#xA0;</span>they became aware of it and fled to the cities of Lycaonia, Lystra, Derbe, and the surrounding region.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#xA0;</span>There they preached the Good News. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#xA0;</span>At Lystra a certain man sat, impotent in his feet, a cripple from his mother&#x2019;s womb, who never had walked.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#xA0;</span>He was listening to Paul speaking, who, fastening eyes on him and seeing that he had faith to be made whole,  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#xA0;</span>said with a loud voice, &#x201C;Stand upright on your feet!&#x201D; He leapt up and walked.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#xA0;</span>When the multitude saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voice, saying in the language of Lycaonia, &#x201C;The gods have come down to us in the likeness of men!&#x201D;  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#xA0;</span>They called Barnabas &#x201C;Jupiter&#x201D;, and Paul &#x201C;Mercury&#x201D;, because he was the chief speaker.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#xA0;</span>The priest of Jupiter, whose temple was in front of their city, brought oxen and garlands to the gates, and would have made a sacrifice along with the multitudes. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#xA0;</span>But when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of it, they tore their clothes and sprang into the multitude, crying out,  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#xA0;</span>&#x201C;Men, why are you doing these things? We also are men of the same nature as you, and bring you good news, that you should turn from these vain things to the living God, who made the sky, the earth, the sea, and all that is in them;  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#xA0;</span>who in the generations gone by allowed all the nations to walk in their own ways.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#xA0;</span>Yet he didn&#x2019;t leave himself without witness, in that he did good and gave you<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">&#x2020;<span class="popup"> TR reads &#x201C;us&#x201D; instead of &#x201C;you&#x201D;</span></a> rains from the sky and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#xA0;</span>Even saying these things, they hardly stopped the multitudes from making a sacrifice to them.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#xA0;</span>But some Jews from Antioch and Iconium came there, and having persuaded the multitudes, they stoned Paul and dragged him out of the city, supposing that he was dead. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#xA0;</span>But as the disciples stood around him, he rose up, and entered into the city.
