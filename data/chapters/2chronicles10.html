Now therefore make the grievous service of your father and his heavy yoke which he put on us, lighter, and we will serve you.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#xA0;</span>He said to them, &#x201C;Come again to me after three days.&#x201D; </div><div class="p">So the people departed. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#xA0;</span>King Rehoboam took counsel with the old men, who had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, &#x201C;What counsel do you give me about how to answer these people?&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#xA0;</span>They spoke to him, saying, &#x201C;If you are kind to these people, please them, and speak good words to them, then they will be your servants forever.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#xA0;</span>But he abandoned the counsel of the old men which they had given him, and took counsel with the young men who had grown up with him, who stood before him.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#xA0;</span>He said to them, &#x201C;What counsel do you give, that we may give an answer to these people, who have spoken to me, saying, &#x2018;Make the yoke that your father put on us lighter?&#x2019;&#xA0;&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#xA0;</span>The young men who had grown up with him spoke to him, saying, &#x201C;Thus you shall tell the people who spoke to you, saying, &#x2018;Your father made our yoke heavy, but make it lighter on us;&#x2019; thus you shall say to them, &#x2018;My little finger is thicker than my father&#x2019;s waist.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#xA0;</span>Now whereas my father burdened you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke.
