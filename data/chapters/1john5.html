Whoever loves the Father also loves the child who is born of him.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#xA0;</span>By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and keep his commandments.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#xA0;</span>For this is loving God, that we keep his commandments. His commandments are not grievous.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#xA0;</span>For whatever is born of God overcomes the world. This is the victory that has overcome the world: your faith.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#xA0;</span>Who is he who overcomes the world, but he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God? </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#xA0;</span>This is he who came by water and blood, Jesus Christ; not with the water only, but with the water and the blood. It is the Spirit who testifies, because the Spirit is the truth.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#xA0;</span>For there are three who testify:<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Only a few recent manuscripts add &#x201C;in heaven: the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit; and these three are one.

He who doesn&#x2019;t believe God has made him a liar, because he has not believed in the testimony that God has given concerning his Son.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#xA0;</span>The testimony is this: that God gave to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#xA0;</span>He who has the Son has the life.
