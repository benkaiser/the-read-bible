</div><div class="chapterlabel" id="V0"> 1</div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#xA0;</span>The elder to Gaius the beloved, whom I love in truth. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#xA0;</span>Beloved, I pray that you may prosper in all things and be healthy, even as your soul prospers.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#xA0;</span>For I rejoiced greatly when brothers came and testified about your truth, even as you walk in truth.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#xA0;</span>I have no greater joy than this: to hear about my children walking in truth. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#xA0;</span>Beloved, you do a faithful work in whatever you accomplish for those who are brothers and strangers.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#xA0;</span>They have testified about your love before the assembly. You will do well to send them forward on their journey in a way worthy of God,  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#xA0;</span>because for the sake of the Name they went out, taking nothing from the Gentiles.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#xA0;</span>We therefore ought to receive such, that we may be fellow workers for the truth. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#xA0;</span>I wrote to the assembly, but Diotrephes, who loves to be first amongst them, doesn&#x2019;t accept what we say.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#xA0;</span>Therefore, if I come, I will call attention to his deeds which he does, unjustly accusing us with wicked words. Not content with this, he doesn&#x2019;t receive the brothers himself, and those who would, he forbids and throws out of the assembly. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#xA0;</span>Beloved, don&#x2019;t imitate that which is evil, but that which is good. He who does good is of God. He who does evil hasn&#x2019;t seen God.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#xA0;</span>Demetrius has the testimony of all, and of the truth itself; yes, we also testify, and you know that our testimony is true. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#xA0;</span>I had many things to write to you, but I am unwilling to write to you with ink and pen;  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#xA0;</span>but I hope to see you soon. Then we will speak face to face. </div><div class="p">Peace be to you. The friends greet you. Greet the friends by name. </div>
