He will surely deal with him. I have driven him out for his wickedness.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#xA0;</span>Foreigners, the tyrants of the nations, have cut him off and have left him. His branches have fallen on the mountains and in all the valleys, and his boughs are broken by all the watercourses of the land. All the peoples of the earth have gone down from his shadow and have left him.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#xA0;</span>All the birds of the sky will dwell on his ruin, and all the animals of the field will be on his branches,  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#xA0;</span>to the end that none of all the trees by the waters exalt themselves in their stature, and don&#x2019;t set their top amongst the thick boughs. Their mighty ones don&#x2019;t stand up on their height, even all who drink water; for they are all delivered to death, to the lower parts of the earth, amongst the children of men, with those who go down to the pit.&#x2019; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#xA0;</span>&#x201C;The Lord GOD says: &#x2018;In the day when he went down to Sheol,<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Sheol is the place of the dead.</span></a> I caused a mourning. I covered the deep for him, and I restrained its rivers. The great waters were stopped. I caused Lebanon to mourn for him, and all the trees of the field fainted for him.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#xA0;</span>I made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall, when I cast him down to Sheol<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">&#x2020;<span class="popup"> Sheol is the place of the dead.</span></a> with those who descend into the pit. All the trees of Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, all that drink water, were comforted in the lower parts of the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#xA0;</span>They also went down into Sheol with him to those who are slain by the sword; yes, those who were his arm, who lived under his shadow in the middle of the nations. </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#xA0;</span>&#x201C;&#xA0;&#x2018;To whom are you thus like in glory and in greatness amongst the trees of Eden?
