He took her, lay with her, and humbled her.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#xA0;</span>His soul joined to Dinah, the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the young lady, and spoke kindly to the young lady.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#xA0;</span>Shechem spoke to his father, Hamor, saying, &#x201C;Get me this young lady as a wife.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#xA0;</span>Now Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah, his daughter; and his sons were with his livestock in the field.

The men were grieved, and they were very angry, because he had done folly in Israel in lying with Jacob&#x2019;s daughter, a thing that ought not to be done.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#xA0;</span>Hamor talked with them, saying, &#x201C;The soul of my son, Shechem, longs for your daughter. Please give her to him as a wife.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#xA0;</span>Make marriages with us. Give your daughters to us, and take our daughters for yourselves.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#xA0;</span>You shall dwell with us, and the land will be before you.

If you will be as we are, that every male of you be circumcised,  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#xA0;</span>then will we give our daughters to you; and we will take your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#xA0;</span>But if you will not listen to us and be circumcised, then we will take our sister,<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Hebrew has, literally, &#x201C;daughter&#x201D;</span></a> and we will be gone.&#x201D; </div><div class="p"> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#xA0;</span>Their words pleased Hamor and Shechem, Hamor&#x2019;s son.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#xA0;</span>The young man didn&#x2019;t wait to do this thing, because he had delight in Jacob&#x2019;s daughter, and he was honoured above all the house of his father.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#xA0;</span>Hamor and Shechem, his son, came to the gate of their city, and talked with the men of their city, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#xA0;</span>&#x201C;These men are peaceful with us.
